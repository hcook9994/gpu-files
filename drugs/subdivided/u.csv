0,"I&#039;ve tried a few antidepressants over the years (citalopram, fluoxetine, amitriptyline), but none of those helped with my depression, insomnia &amp; anxiety. My doctor suggested and changed me onto 45mg mirtazapine and this medicine has saved my life. Thankfully I have had no side effects especially the most common - weight gain, I&#039;ve actually lost alot of weight. I still have suicidal thoughts but mirtazapine has saved me.",UNK
1,"My son has Crohn&#039;s disease and has done very well on the Asacol.  He has no complaints and shows no side effects.  He has taken as many as nine tablets per day at one time.  I&#039;ve been very happy with the results, reducing his bouts of diarrhea drastically.",UNK
2,"Contrave combines drugs that were used for alcohol, smoking, and opioid cessation. People lose weight on it because it also helps control over-eating. I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two. I&#039;m hoping that after a few months on this medication, I will develop healthier habits that I can continue without the aid of Contrave.",UNK
3,I have been on this birth control for one cycle. After reading some of the reviews on this type and similar birth controls I was a bit apprehensive to start. Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping! I had unprotected sex the first month and obviously didn&#039;t get pregnant so I&#039;m very pleased! Highly recommend,UNK
4,"4 days in on first 2 weeks.  Using on arms and face. Put vaseline on lips, under eyes and in nostrils to protect from cream.  So far no reaction at all.  I know I have many pre cancer and thought I would light up like a Christmas tree but so far so good.  Maybe it&#039;s coming but time will tell.",UNK
5,"I&#039;ve had the copper coil for about 3 months now. I was really excited at the thought of not taking hormones. I&#039;m good with pain however I nearly fainted with insertion, couldn&#039;t belive how painful it was; the doctor did say it is very painful for some. Well 3 months in, my periods last 11 days and I&#039;m in pain for about 15 days with random twangs especially in the left side and I&#039;m considering whether I want to put up with the intense pain and heavy periods. I&#039;d recommend this 100% to somebody who doesn&#039;t already have heavy painful periods but right now it just isn&#039;t for me",UNK
6,"This has been great for me. I&#039;ve been on it for 2 weeks and in the last week I only had 3 headaches which went away with 2 Tylenol. I was having chronic daily headaches that wouldn&#039;t go away no matter what I took. I&#039;m still a little sleepy during the day, but I know that will get better. I take 10mg at night.",UNK

I am at 3 mgs and really starting to feel the withdraw.I don&#039;t plan to get my next 30 doses.because its almost rediculous how little it does for me. I have 3 does doses of 3 mg and Im terrified. Can anyone give me some truthful encouragement?.....",UNK
8,"I was on this pill for almost two years. It does work as far as not getting pregnant however my experience at first was it didn&#039;t make a huge difference then 6 or 7 months into it my sex drive went down, along with being very very dry, my moodiness increased drastically. I would cry one second and then get angry with my husband over anything and everything. My skin has gotten a lot worse, I broke out in places I never had in the last week. So now I am on Yaz.",UNK
9,"Holy Hell is exactly how I feel. I had been taking Brisdelle for 1.5 years. The hot flashes did indeed subside - however, the side affects of this medicine coupled with the fact Noven was acquired by YET another pharmaceutical company - YOU CAN&#039;T PLACE A REP IN THE AREA, DISTRIBUTE YOUR DRUGS, AND THEN FIRE HER-AND NOT REPLACE THEREFORE there is NO medicine or support here. You dumped this drug in the Dr&#039;s hands and walked away. After calling Sebula - you act like you don&#039;t even care. You have made it impossible to obtain this. I happen to think this is illegal.  I just decided to wean myself off this and Premarin. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. If you don&#039;t need this drug- DON&#039;T START. Seriously.",UNK
10,Honestly its day one on the 3 day treatment. Yes it burns a bit and it does leak out if you dont lay down after insertion. But im faithful it will work.,UNK
11,Ditto on rebound sleepless when discontinued. I have done very strange things with no memory including taking additional Ambien. It has helped me sleep when under extreme stress but watch out. Now I am trying to learn how to sleep naturally.,UNK
12,"A doctor in the ER prescribed me 200 mg of Provigil when I was first diagnosed with Narcolepsy. It didn&#039;t seem to have any effect on me at all. Then I went to see my sleep doctor and he prescribed me 250 mg of Nuvigil. It finally allowed me to stay awake for an entire day. But if I went out somewhere I would be able to come home and take a nap and be fully awake again. Taking that with Xyrem makes me feel 98%..not quite 100, but still pretty great.",UNK
13,I smoked for 50+ years.  Took it for one week and that was it.  I didn&#039;t think it was possible for me to quit.  It has been 6 years now.  Great product.,UNK
14,"So I was on Ginanvi for about 3 months before I switched over to this pill due to the high cost of Ginavi (I don&#039;t have insurance). Ginanvi had cleared up my acne in the short time I used and I was hoping this birth control would not mess that up. I was wrong. After 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. Now, 9 months later I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it. It also made my period &quot;weird&quot;. I would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next . The month that I had a heavier flow my boobs would hurt a lot. I also noticed that at the beginning of taking it , I would be moody and extremely irritable all the time . It&#039;s time for me to switch.",UNK
15,"If I could give it a 0, I would absolutely do so.  Started at 50mg, and felt WIRED.  Wanted to get up and clean the house!  Bumped it to 100mg, less wired, but still wide awake all night.  Bumped to 150, with the same lack of effect.  MD informed me after this dose it becomes less effective for sleep, so why even bother.  15 years of trying different sleep medications and alternatives, and this, I can say for sure, was the LEAST effective I have ever come across.  At it&#039;s low price point, feel free to give it a try, and maybe you will be luckier?  Everyone&#039;s sleep conditions are different.  But if you get hyper after benadryl, expect the same reaction to this drug.",UNK
16,"I am so happy with the samples provided by my Endocrinologist. The only thing I am so sad about is that I cannot afford the prohibitive costs. However, overall this is the best thing I&#039;ve ever had to make my Irritable Bowel Syndrome-D tolerable. I can go out of the house again without worrying and the terrible stomach pains are a thing of the past.",UNK
17,"After a few days and it &quot;kicked in,&quot; every noise in the house would make me jump, pictures on TV would feel as if they were 3-D and make me jump, and I literally felt like my skin was crawling, moving, and melding to things, such as blankets. My mind focused and keyed in on every piece of white noise there was and I had sweaty, night hot flashes with chills.",UNK
18,"This drug is pretty amazing. I&#039;ve had hyperhydrosis of the palms, soles and underarms since hitting puberty. I was skeptic since I&#039;ve previously tried botox, iontophoresis and drysol with limited results. However, after three days of taking oxybutynin (5mg 3x a day) I was 95% sweat-free. My only negative things to say about the drug is about side effects. I have gotten fairly dizzy/spaced out a few times, and I experience dry mouth pretty often. However, that&#039;s not bad in comparison to the acne I&#039;ve gotten. I used to get pimples around once a month, however now I have ones lasting for &lt;6 wks, varying in size/colour. I constantly have groups of acne on my face. Does anyone have any remedies? I&#039;ve tried acne masks, cleansers and tea tree oil.",UNK
19,"This medication should not be being prescribed for Bipolar 2, a milder form of a different illness, called Biploar 1, for which this medication works very well. Folks, Doctors NEED to be using SCIENCE to treat illnesses, not giving out random prescriptions for 2+ medications for 1 illness. If your Doctor is not doing monthly blood tests AT LEAST to see how the medications are affecting your body chemistry and serotonin levels, then you need to fire the Doctor and find one who does do his/her job the right way, and who is good at the science part of the job. Every medication you take counteracts and interacts with the other medications and the foods and other things that you put into your body each day messing with the chemistry of your body",UNK

Thus far I have experienced significant improvements in controlling my bipolar II disorder. I recently paired 100mg of sertraline to improve the lows. Also, I experience rapid cycling. I rated this drug 70% as I feel I still have a long way to go in recovery. But, the drug has definitely allowed me to be a highly functioning individual.",UNK
22,"I absolutely love this product and recommend to everyone. I know everyone&#039;s body is different, so it is not for everyone, but it is not the medicines fault. I have NO negative symptoms since I started this. I used to have heavy periods, terrible cramps and headaches, and my periods were super long. I now have super consistent 3-4 LIGHT periods, no cramps or headaches. I have been on this pill for over a year now and have no desire to switch.",UNK
23,I&#039;ve had rosacea for almost 20 years and have been on all kinds of antibiotics. Most I am allergic to the last was erythromycin which worked okay. But the Dr though it was time for me to get off the antibiotics. I&#039;ve been on Soolantra for about 6 months and my face has never looked better. I&#039;m thrilled with everything about it. You do use just a dab so a tube will last at least 3 months if not more. I do have insurance that helps a lot with the cost but what I do pay is well worth it.,UNK
24,"This stuff wasn&#039;t too bad!  I had a hard time with the first dose as I&#039;m not used to very sugary drinks and such.  Because of this, I did think it tasted quite gross.  It had a strange grape salty flavor but it was only 16 oz, so it wasn&#039;t too bad to get down.  I had absolutely no discomfort or nausea.  It worked very fast and I was completely clean for the colonoscopy - this was my first colonoscopy and after having read the awful reviews of the gallon jug prep, I went for this stuff.",UNK
25,"my advice on movantik is understand that movantik is an opioid blocker in the same manner that naloxone (found in suboxone) is an opioid blocker. My husband took 12.5mg and was thrown in withdrawal. Nausea first, chills, fever, shaking so hard the bed was vibrating. I thought movantik worked on the backed up s**t but it stops the opioid from working. Of course you will have diarrhea when your pain meds are cut off. It may not happen to everyone but it happened to my husband. I guess it&#039;s back to OIC",UNK

Plan was to go to 60mg but I am getting enough relief at 30mg. I believe I will try to stay on that dose to minimize side effects. Some constipation, difficult reaching orgasm, some night sweats and minor headaches. Oh, insomnia if I took it at night.  I had samples of this medicine for 6 months but delayed starting it because of horror stories on the internet. Pain was ruining my life so this medicine seems to be the best option.",UNK
28,"I was on this for 5 years (and birth control pills for about 12 years), and would have told you how fabulous it was.  &lt;List all the benefits everyone else has listed, here.&gt;  Then a friend of mine convinced me to stop birth control all together for a while, and I turned into a new and better person!  I dropped 5 lbs instantly, had a huge sex drive, more lubrication, and just felt better.  I wouldn&#039;t say I was depressed before, but after going off of it, I would describe my time on birth control as feeling like I was inside a cloud.  Less emotions in general, sometimes a little down.  I&#039;m bummed I&#039;m back on it, but it seems to be the least impactful than the others.  I might try Paragard to avoid the hormones.",UNK

I experienced a lot of change.  I was also in a relationship that made me unhappy. I stopped doing the things I liked to do such as run, party, work, hang out with friends etc. In result, I never had energy. I constantly felt guilty. I cried everyday, sometimes multiple times of day. I went to group therapy. I dropped 10lbs in two weeks. I eventually got on this medicine &amp; the first 4 days felt crazy &amp; tired!

The incident occur in Nov 18 (the condom broke) and it was 4 days after my period ended and approximately 4 days before ovulation. This means I was fertile. 
when we noticed that the condom broke, we immediately bought Plan B One Step and was taken about 45 minutes or an hour later. 
The sooner you take the greater the chances it will work.
So I waited anxiously, praying I get my period. I felt side effects such as fatigue, bloated, nauseous, cramps, and moody. I was that these might be  this pregnancy symptoms. 
I waited exactly two weeks and I got my period. I was the happiest person ever. My period was here early by approximately 3-4 days. Good luck.",UNK
34,"I&#039;m absolutely DONE taking this horrible birth control! I&#039;ve  been taking Aubra for a month and a half... I&#039;m moody, irritable, depressed, hungry, bitchy... vaginal discharge has changed  (gross), my urine smells, my acne has gotten so out of hand and it&#039;s STUBBORN. Cystic acne all around my mouth, jawline, Chin and neck. After doing some research online, I discovered I&#039;m not the only one. Birth control is different for everyone but this is going in the trash... I will not be taking this any longer. It also kills your sex drive... as for the difference in bleeding, I wouldn&#039;t know. I started this pill on day 1 of menstrual cycle last month and haven&#039;t had a period yet... have had plenty of headaches though! ",UNK
35,"Our condom seemed to not have worked properly, but I had to work so I didn&#039;t take the pill until about 18 hours later. I have taken the two pill process about a year ago when the same had happened, and I didn&#039;t become pregnant then nor experience side effects that were noticeable. With this pill, I have been tired, but I am a teacher who works long hours and grades late into the evening so I didn&#039;t attribute it to the pill. I was not nauseated but took it a couple of hours before bed and was my usual tired self. My period came 5 days later with a vengance (strong cramps/heavier bleeding). It is 2 weeks early, which scared me a bit. That is why I wrote this review and sought out others. I also experienced diarrhea due to cramps being so strong.",UNK
36,"I started on the oral contraceptive pill but got horrible nausea and vomiting, so this was my next option. NuvaRing has been fantastic, it has a fraction of the hormones and I get no nausea. Insertion and removing is really not a hassle, and you cannot feel it at all. For me, it beats the pill and vomiting, along with all the other symptoms. I haven&#039;t had any noticeable mood issues or migraines. I would recommend it to anyone!",UNK
37,"About two months ago I had to switch from LoLestrin Fe to microgestin due to my insurance and pharmacy. Since starting microgestin I&#039;ve noticed insane bloating and nausea and weird discharge. While on lolestrin, my periods consisted of spotting and average side effects, nothing too serious, but after one month of micro I got my period and it was heavy and the cramping was so painful I had to leave my class. I&#039;ve also noticed I&#039;ve developed bad depression and my mood swings are very intense. My anxiety is bad and my sex drive is very low if not nonexistent anymore. It helped with my acne but I&#039;m a lot more paranoid about getting pregnant than I was on lolestrin. I&#039;m going to be talking to my doctor about possibly getting the shot.",UNK
38,"Coming from a very problematic childhood, I&#039;ve been labeled everything from A to Z by psychiatrists and given a slew of meds. Wellbutrin in my experience has been beyond beneficial. At first for the first week or two I had slight tremors, irregular heartbeat, major insomnia and headaches but dismissed. I still have slight insomnia which is why I take them when I wake up. But reading comprehension, multitasking, thought focus and moods overall have dramatically improved! I&#039;m one of those people that may have to take them for the rest of my life but I&#039;m not complaining =). One thing that does bother me tho is dry mouth from wellbutrin but I take biotene which helps a bit. Enough to make it worth it anyways lol.",UNK
39,"My GP had prescribed this to me at my requests for something to deal with my acne. I used this medication for about a month or a little longer. This medication dries out my face something terrible. I had to slather moisturizer on my face, which was probably counterintuitive. The medication worked well at drying out existing acne on my face but did nothing to prevent new acne. Every day I would wake up to new zits. I ended up going to a dermatologist and had something else prescribed.

It&#039;s starting to cool off but damn. This is only day 1 and I hope it&#039;s only the first day. I&#039;d like to think it&#039;s because the medication is reacting to the irritation from instance itching I was doing down there before buying the cream. Lol. Because unless Monistat change their ingredients, I can&#039;t think of any other logical reason for this severe burning like never before.",UNK

Then my period started coming twice a month with horrific cramps. Or I would spot for 2-3 weeks have a week where I thought It was over and started spotting again. I&#039;ve now had it for 13 months and it does the job because I havent gotten pregnant.

After a year and a half of not taking birth control at all, I began taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for acne, and after 4 months my skin is MUCH clearer.  If I do get pimples, they are much smaller and more shallow than before, and go away quicker.  I am pleased!",UNK

My OB-GYN instructed me to skip the placebos, and as a result I have had virtually no cramping or break through bleeding (common on my last pill). However, as she warned, I developed severe acne. The acne I could deal with, but the emotional side effects I cannot. I have become increasingly moody the longer I have been on Cryselle, especially around the time of my &quot;period&quot;. I have also developed strong feelings of anxiety and depression. I had hoped when these symptoms began, that they would lessen over time, but they have just increased in severity. ",UNK
48,"Yes, this medication does work wonders, at first.  Diagnosed ADHD (by a Psychiatrist)  at the age of 26.  The first 3 years it worked quite well and felt like a godsend.

Adderall, like other CNS stimulants, tend to become less effective after time and I noticed this more pronouncedly by my 5th year.  At that point, I felt trapped by the drug and tried to stop.  The problem was that even after a month or more without Adderall, none of discontinuation symptoms were improving.  While I continue to use Adderall for maintenance, I derive little benefit.  Be aware, the effects won&#039;t last indefinitely!",UNK

Detoxing med free from this med was horrendous! After detox most of the side effects cleared up. But I still have issues with memory and concentration. This is the only med I took on a reg bases as my health was good. Im still suffering the side effects of the Withdrawl from it. Studies should be for longer than 12 weeks.",UNK
51,honestly the measurement hurt more than the actual placement! And I&#039;m so happy I went through with it!!! I wish I didn&#039;t read all of these reviews before I did it. Pain is subjective and its not that bad. They explained the procedure to me and I felt more comfortable. I&#039;ve never had kids. Its just like getting a regular pap. I think it is the best option of birth control. That being said I will definitely recommend getting this! Do expect cramping for a day or two. I didnt cramp until about three hours after having it done. I took ibuprophen and slept with a heating bad. Very mild cramping today but I am happy with my choice :),UNK

53,"I was prescribed this for onset of anxiety and possible hormonal mood swings. I was not told by my doctor how it would make me feel or how hard coming off of it would be. I took one 37.5 mg capsule and was horrified that I was given this. I woke up at 2am with an anxiety attack for about the first hour. It then went into being wired, nauseous, shakey, weak, chills and sweating. 11 years ago I quit using meth and this was awful that I felt like I was on it again. I laid in bed the entire day, wide awake and ill. I never took another dose! And even one pill took at least another full day to leave my system. My nervous system is obviously sensitive and I could not handle this medication at all.",UNK

Even at 43 I still call my mommy. She wasn&#039;t thrilled I was going to take it anyway since I have perfect blood pressure. But she recommended laying on my left side. That did help even if it did take awhile for me to get warm again. The headache is still lingering.",UNK

I feel more energetic, as If I have to be doing something. My mind will not stop repeating the same thoughts, over and over again. I am also very hungry and have an increased appetite. It does however, cause me to think about things differently as I know what my general reaction to things would be, or have been in the past, but, it allows me time to think of an alternative besides being explosive. It has calmed me, and more than once, has helped me to cope with a situation differently and more calmly. Overall, I think I&#039;m doing well so far. I plan to continue this medication for some time.",UNK
56,Since I was on the trials I put 6+ months but I have been back on Afrezza for about 2 weeks.  Afrezza is nothing short of a miracle. I am a type 1 diabetic and my blood sugar average in the past 10 days has been 110. I have a CGM so I have had 2880 readings in the past 10 days.  A 110 average equals to an A1C of 5.45. This is possible because Afrezza mimics the speed of a healthy pancreas. Afrezza starts working in only 12-15 minutes and works out of my system very quickly.

58,"I was prescribed Bactrim for a kidney infection. I took two doses, 500 mgs each. After the first dose, I began to feel lousy. I assumed it was a side effect. The second dose almost killed me. I went to the ER, where I was stabilized enough to move me to ICU. Before I lost consciousness, my blood pressure was 35/27. I woke up 3 days later with a central line, severely swollen body, and my skin was bright red, like a severe sunburn. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital, with my blood pressure constantly plummeting. I apparently have a severe allergy.",UNK

60,"I had major depression from the time I started menstruating.  It would cycle with my cycle.  It caused paranoia, and fear of being seen outside my home.  It feared going to my mail box, yet, at times I would sign up to do things like be an Avon Lady! I felt crazy. In my mid 30&#039;s, divorced, alcoholic, my doctor prescribed Prozac.  It didn&#039;t seem to help me.  Later in recovery but still profoundly depressed, she put me on Zoloft and the result was instantaneous.  I felt like a window to my life had been opened.  I wasn&#039;t afraid.  I looked forward to getting out of bed.  I found things I liked to do. I have a healthy relationship, a good job, a life.  I have been given my life back.  Now, I am 16 years sober.  Thank you Zoloft.",UNK
61,So in high school over ten years ago I started to sweat really bad under my arms. It was super embarrassing to go through high school with this issue. After trying over the counter products and home remedies I gave up. So my Dr at the time recommended Drysol. I used it for just a few weeks and it worked so good. But then after a few months I noticed my armpits darkening. So I stopped using it. Now about 15 yrs later I&#039;ve tried so many things to lighten my armpits and nothing works. This stuff did 100% cure my sweaty armpits and I can now freely wear shirts without the sweat marks. But it burned me so bad that I have dark scars for life and still can&#039;t walk around freely with tank tops. I guess you can&#039;t win them all.,UNK

Within 10 hours of the first dose I had severe anxiety - something I had never experienced before. Within hours of second dose the extreme nausea came on. By day 3 I was pratically bed-ridden in cold sweats and feeling completely &quot;out of it&quot; . I persevered hoping the effects would begin to subside but by the 5th day I had severe nausea, couldn&#039;t get out of bed from feeling so sick, horrible tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and felt spaced out to the point that I began to wonder if I would ever feel &quot;normal&quot; again. Advised by GP to cease immediately on hearing my side effects.",UNK

I&#039;m lucky I didn&#039;t need surgery like some women,UNK
64,"Pregabalin for me was miraculous. On the first dose (75mg three times a day) my anxiety was reversed. I really thought this was too good to be true. I have tried Prozac and lorazepam at different times of my life. But as is commonly known, after the fourth or fifth trial of SSRIs, they &quot;peter out&quot; and actually become counter productive, even in some cases causing serotonin syndrome. But about two years ago, I was in a very stressful marriage break-up and was taking benzodiazepines to keep the lid on the anxiety, with little effect. The GP respected my wish to try Lyrica. I was and still am, after two years, astounded by this transformation. I feel like I always felt I should feel. A cessation of anxiety and a sense of well being pervades. ",UNK

I was then put on Welbutrin while still taking 25mg of Zoloft. I quit smoking (had no desire to smoke) but then became suicidal. My doctor then put me back on Effexor and I currently only take 75 mg. I feel amazing. Yeah the side effects are bad, I&#039;ve gained weight (lost weight the first time I was on it), have sexual side effects, and get quite shaky/jittery if I&#039;m late on a dose.

Now 3-4 years later my problems is still the same, doctors refuse to belive me, but I&#039;m certain, I had very high sex drive before my first Prozac/Fontex pill. No I can&#039;t keep my erection more than 5 seconds and my penis often feels numb. This pill should have been illegal. (Sorry for my poor english)",UNK
114,I&#039;m a 32 year old male and I&#039;ve been taking buspar for about 10 months. At first it did nothing but make my anxiety worse. I would wake up with to full blown panic attacks and have the worse nightmares ever. However I&#039;m now taking 40mg of citaloptam a day mixed with the buspar 15mg and 1mg of xanax twice a day. And Zanax! I have  insomnia mixed with with deep anxiety issues. The problem that I have is the buspar makes me so fat! I&#039;m literally considering stop taking it and just see of the other meds can help. Buspar Alone is no  substitution for anxiety drug and wouldn&#039;t recommend it...,UNK
115,"I&#039;ve been on Kariva for 5 months now, and am looking to switch. I get my period the third week of pills for several days, and then again the fourth week as a full period. Both sets of periods I get come with cramps, bloating (and several pounds of weight gain, which disappears once my period is over), and moodiness. When I asked my doctor to switch initially, she suggested I wait several months, as sometimes these effects subside, but mine have not.",UNK
116,"I was really worried at first because of all the negative comments. I just finished my first month of Microgestin, and I had absolutely no side effects. I have not seen significant weight gain or terrible acne. In fact, I think this medication has actually reduced my acne! My skin&#039;s clear and smooth, and I don&#039;t have painful heavy periods anymore. I think it&#039;s worth giving this medication a try!",UNK
117,I have been taking Victoza for about a month. Started at 0.6mg for the first two weeks and lost about 3 pounds. Increased to 1.2mg after two weeks and have lost an extra 9 pounds for a total of twelve pounds the first month. My main complaint is a little upset stomach and a little diarrhea. But I can handle it for the sake of weight loss. I seriously cannot eat no where near as much as before.  I used to be able to eat 6 pieces of a papa John&#039;s large pizza in one sitting. Now I can barely eat 2 without the crust. I have waaaaayyyy more energy now. I don&#039;t understand how some people are having problems with injection site.  I Wash my hands and use alcohol to clean injection site before I give myself the shot.,UNK

breast bone (radiation treatment) and finally my lung and adrenal gland. At that
point I was put on Sutent 50mg which caused white count issues. We dialed down to
37.5 which stabilized the blood and now after three months my tumors have shrunk by half. Side effects are not pleasant but tolerable. Bottom line I am still alive
thanks to Sutent.",UNK
119,"I&#039;ve been on this birth control for a year and I have to say that it&#039;s very practical for my body. I used to get brutal cramps and long periods. No matter what type of birth control I had debilitating cramps. Lolo has caused my cramps to stop and my period is consistent and lasts 2 days. Only downside is I did get some acne, but the acne may be just due to something else since I&#039;ve dealt with breakouts prior to trying lolo. Also my boobs grew a lot which I&#039;m happy about. This medication is not for everyone, if you experience adverse effects stop taking it immediately as it does not agree with every woman.",UNK
120,"After I was discharged from intensive care, I reported no pain, and no pain killers were given previously. After given Tylenol 3 in liquid form, and I started to experience pain with an extra large headache. The pain was in my eyes, temples, and ears not to mention throat. I got cold and my legs started to shake. Then I experienced more swelling in my throat than before, but I thought that this was post op normal. After the second dose I started to panic quietly inside and I couldn&#039;t get liquid Advil out of my mind! The nurse only had tablets, so my husband arrived and rushed me to the pharmacy to get some Chldrens liquid Advil, and 30 minutes later I was pain free! I&#039;m not touching my prescription for Tylenol 3 and will tell the doc ASAP.",UNK

I had to take 3 bottles in 24 hrs  for the colonoscopy.  My butt was terribly raw,  I used cold pressed castor oil, but I heard A&amp;D ointment works good and prob won&#039;t be as oily..  It took 2 hrs to work with just 8 ozs of water, but would have worked sooner if I had taken 16 ozs of water.  The more water you drink the more it will work.

123,"So, I&#039;ve had a yeast infection for two weeks thinking it would go away like the last one. I was completely wrong! My sister decided lets go to the grocery store last night. So, I was all for the trip just to get Monistat. Now, I&#039;ve tried the 7-day and 3-day. The seven day made my very uncomfortable I felt as though ants were down there, but the 3 day just didn&#039;t work. I&#039;ve got a diflucan but it didn&#039;t clear it. I told myself give Monistat one more time. I grabbed the 1-day off the shelf went home and used it around 9pm. Oh my gosh I have seen a complete improvement overnight. Thank you no more symptoms this morning.",UNK
124,"I have been getting the shot since having my 3rd baby 17 months ago. Honestly, the 1st year was awesome! No periods, no mood swings, and no weight gain! Actually improved my moods and I lost all my baby weight right away. I was also breastfeeding at the time. As soon as I stopped when my son was 12 mos old, I guess the hormones in my body changed and reacted differently with the shot. I started bleeding for weeks at a time. I would bleed light to moderate for about 3-4 weeks and then stop for about 2 weeks and start up again. I&#039;ve now gained about 10-15 lbs. and I&#039;m starting to break out a bit and I never break out. Also my moods are definitely off. I can really feel the difference. Up and down all the time. It was great while it lasted!",UNK
125,I hate this birth control. I was originally taking Gianvi which I absolutely loved because I didn&#039;t gain ANY weight. My acne cleared up and I stayed slim. For some reason my pharmacy switched me to Nikki and in 2 months I went from 121 to 143. I am 5&#039;4 and I lift weights 5 days a week. I use to be defined/toned and now I&#039;m so bloated all the time I look fluffy and bulky. I do NOT like this birth control and my skin does not like it either!! :(,UNK
126,So I&#039;ve been on this birth control for about three months. In the beginning I was hungry all the time and it really upset my stomach. After about three weeks that was gone and it was awesome. No babies. Easy periods almost no cramps it was too good to be true. Now here I am three months into the pill and I&#039;ve hit a horrible depression. I&#039;ve never been depressed. But everyday I cry and get so sad I can&#039;t go out and I don&#039;t want to eat or do anything. I&#039;ve diminished. So I&#039;ve decided to get off the pill immediately. I think I&#039;ll stick to the condoms. I would rather use condoms than be overwhelmingly sad all the time.,UNK
127,"Me and my boyfriend did the deed on 3/10, the condom had broke. My period had just ended. We didn&#039;t realize until after when he was pulling out. We immediately began to panic. I took a quick rinse off shower (don&#039;t know if this is the best idea but oh well) after I rinsed off we went to the store and bought plan b. We went home right after and I took it. I was feeling really nervous about this whole thing. I began to read so many reviews. On 3/14 I began to bleed very heavily and had cramps that lasted for 6 days. I started having cramps, my breast hurt, and everything u can think. I was due 4/3. I took a test and it came back NEG. I was 12 days late before it finally came! It takes time but I promise everything will be okay in the end!",UNK
128,"Only the brand name version of Effexor works for me.  Luckily my medical insurance agreed with my doctor and authorized me to continue getting the brand name version.

I have found it to be very effective.  An Interesting &quot;good side effect&quot; is it helps with my serious face pain. A win win medicine.",UNK
129,"I was taking regular Trazodone on and off for a couple of years, it stopped working so my doctor switched me to Desyrel. It&#039;s a good pill for the fact that it does make you tired, but I&#039;d make sure you&#039;re gonna get 8 or more hours of sleep before you take it. I was prescribed 100mg pills, and I only took half of a pill whenever I took it, and I had the hardest time waking up the next day. Also, with the reg Trazodone and with Desyrel, it took a long time for it to kick in for me (2  hours), but that might be because I have a high tolerance to pills. If you&#039;re new to this medicine, take it on the weekend, or whenever you can sleep in, so you can see how it works.",UNK
130,First off let me start off by saying that I am only here because before I started this medication I lived and died by the reviews on here. As a matter of fact had it not been for the reviews I probably never would have taken the chance and been A LOT worse off. If your reading this you&rsquo;re probably at the point where you know you should take this medicine but anxiety is telling you it will harm or kill you. Don&rsquo;t listen to it. It&rsquo;s LYING. This medicine took me from being agoraphobic to attending rock concerts. It doesn&rsquo;t work overnight and the side effects DID suck but they were worth every single one. I have my life back and my only regret is that I waited so long to try. I started in May and by October I was basically a brand new person.,UNK
131,"I was diagnosed with Stage IV Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) in April 2009, and told by my primary care physician that my prognosis was approximately 6-9 months, perhaps a year.

After 3 courses, I have had a complete response - no detectable cancer for 6 months so far.",UNK
132,I&#039;ve never had kids and I am 32 fyi. The insertion was the most pain I&#039;ve ever felt in my life I almost passed out. For the first 3 months I bled everyday and had pretty bad cramps. I am at month 6 now and the cramps are maybe a few times a month. I still spot but its very light and I am not getting my period anymore. It had also helped with the endometriosis. Overall i am satisfied.,UNK
133,"I switched to Gianvi from Aviane in hopes of clearing up my acne. I was VERY excited because Yaz is supposed to be a miracle. My experience was far from a miracle. My skin did not clear up AT ALL, and got worse. I&#039;m a freaking irrational hothead all month. I&#039;m usually very good at shrugging off the small stuff, but it&#039;s like I have absolutely no control over my emotions anymore. I&#039;ve become very lethargic; I could sleep all day if you&#039;d let me. My once raging sex drive is now hardly existent. On the bright side, it did work strictly as birth control (hence the 4 rating). I&#039;ve already made an appointment to switch.",UNK

I was on Seroquel for a many years but switched after the negative effects of my memory and concentration, which ended up being not so subtle; weight gain and oversleeping came a little while after as well, so I found it was time to switch. This is my best try so far after Seroquel, but that&#039;s not saying much.  Having to take this with food   needing to go to sleep pretty much Right After or else getting lost in a paranoid/anxious frenzy/limbo-type state is really quite challenging. I also get tired pretty early which I believe is due to the half-life of the medication (18 hours or so)",UNK

I could remain abstinent for anything from 1 month to 8 months but always relapsed eventually. 4 hospital detoxes, countless home ones and very ill heavy drinking. Had a warning that my liver had early stage of chirrosiss so that scared me enough to try Campral. 6 a day, been on it a month now complete abstinence and generally feel, marvelous with no cravings or thoughts. So far so good. I&#039;m sleeping great and feel calm and more balanced.",UNK

I started experiencing bad cystic acne to the point I had no less than 10 bumps at once and was spending a lot of time and money at the dermatologist on injections. I had never had a cyst before--just typical teen acne breakouts in high school and college. It was painful and I felt embarrassed to go anywhere in public. My self esteem plummeted. After 3 months my dermatologist recommended spironolactone. I started at 200 mg and within a month my face was totally clear. After 6 months I went down to 150, then another 6 months down to 100, which is the dosage I still take 2 years later. Best medication ever!",UNK

I have gained weight while on the shot but it could be just my eating habits and lack of exercise! I would recommend this form of birth control for anyone who cannot remember to take a pill or who does not want to worry about getting pregnant. Once every three months is easy to do and I have never been happier with any form of birth control.",UNK

144,"Valtrex is fantastic if used correctly for cold sores.  For adults the dose is 2 grams at first symptom of a cold sore, followed by 2 grams 12 hours later.  That&#039;s it.  Now the key is getting that first dose right when you feel the first symptom (tingling, burning, swelling etc.)  This medicine has worked great for me and usually prevents the sore from breaking the skin, thus no one even knowing I was getting a cold sore.  Anyone who gets cold sores knows how awful they are and how long they take to heal.  I have not had as much success with acyclovir.

Be sure you always have some Valtrex on hand.  If you wait until you get a cold sore before calling the doctor, it&#039;s probably too late, but take it anyway to reduce healing time.",UNK
145,"I take metoprolol tartrate not metoprolol with hydrochlorthiazide, however I have noticed a marked frequency of urination and polyuria after starting this medication.  My doctor suspected a urinary tract infection (although I am not experiencing dysuria, fever, chills or having any other typical UTI symptoms).  Urinalysis was negative, prostate exam was negative, cystoscopy was negative.

The medicine is doing what it is supposed to be doing, but having to urinate every two hours around the clock is certainly interfering with my sleep.  I did find a reference on Drugs.com that said increased urination was a rarely encountered side effect of this drug, but my doctors insist it doesn&#039;t have that side effect and I have spent a fortune ruling out other conditions.",UNK

On one occasion, I went to Pharmacy on Saturday and they advised I needed a new script.  I had to wait until Monday to get a script and they were the two worst days in my life....the withdrawal was chaotic, I argued with the chemist in a rage....never done this before...I called them an hour later sobbing and apologising for my behavior, I had awful flashes in my eyes and headaches that made a migraine feel like party.....I was frantic at the doctor on the Monday morning",UNK

MY FOREHEAD IS CLEAR and the marks are fading faster. My cheeks are still the same but I can live with my skin again. My skin hated epiduo and it only gave me more acne.

After suffering from pretty bad acne and trying every topical product out there (benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, tea tree oil, sulfur masks, etc.), I had pretty much given up all hope of clear skin. I started Ziana and saw no immediate results, but kept applying every night. A month later, my acne was significantly reduced. Two months later... I only have two small pimples that are in the stage of drying up. I highly recommend Ziana; it seems to be gentle on the skin. Keep with it! The results are amazing. I&#039;m so much more confident. Good luck! P.S. I used in combination with doxycycline, which seems to significantly improve results.",UNK

Yet, she and I talked about it and she is a very level headed conservative girl who needed help and wanted to try. This medicine has been God send for her and her PMDD. He periods are lighter, not as lengthy and there is minimal pain associated with her periods now. Not to mention her mood and anxiety levels have both improved more than I can mention. This medicine has made her feel &quot;normal&quot; again!",UNK

After reading the reviews here I was worried but wanted to try it anyway. There was a HUGE cramp after she measured my uterus &amp; inserted the IUD, what I imagine a contraction feels like. I had lots of cramping afterwards for 2 weeks &amp; on &amp; off spotting for the first 3 months but that&#039;s all gone now. I&#039;m really happy with Skyla, but every body is different.

I would have to say that it took a good 2.5 months to start seeing noticeable improvement with continued improvement the longer I use it. On a side note I would like to add that my ears would flush when triggered by heat or stress and so I started to use Metrogel on them and it has helped reduce the flushing. Overall pretty happy with results only negative aspect is the amount of time it takes for it to work.",UNK
181,"I take it for gastrointestinal pain and it works fairly well. My pain often gets to the point of me wanting to punch everything in sight, and tramadol helps to quiet it.

Additionally, it causes constipation even in low doses, which can contribute to further gastrointestinal pain.",UNK

After a few days i experienced very mild itching and some slight redness, but this may have been my imagination. The warts seemed to get bigger at the start but quickly vanished and now i have no visible warts at all! I used Warticon before and it did absolutely nothing, so i was thrilled to see something finally working. Give it time and patience. One word of advice,  i used this cream and got cryotherapy done around the same time. I would wait a week or so after cryo, apply the cream for a few weeks, then repeat of necessary. This seemed to really help.",UNK

It was very painful for about 3-4 hours. After that, it was similar to my normal cramps for 2 days. I spotted for the first 4 days just enough for a panty liner, not even a pad, and have not had any spotting since.

But, after being on it for 6 months now I&#039;m realizing that this pill is the reason for my poor mental health.

192,"My colonoscopy was booked in for late afternoon on a Thursday. The hospital said to stop eating anything from 1pm on the Wednesday and recommended (giving some detail) a non fibre diet from Tuesday evening until Wednesday noon - avoiding dark drinks and jelly (like blackcurrant flavour). Avoid red meat, sausages and pies; fruit, vegetables and salad; potato skins or fries, wholemeal or brown bread; nuts, pulses, baked beans; wholemeal pasta, brown rice; puddings containing fruit or nuts; cakes and biscuits, yoghurts. Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken, grilled or poached fish, cheese, eggs; white bread, pasta, rice; boiled or mashed potatoes, water, fizzy drinks, fruit squash (not blackcurrant), clear soups, tea or coffee, shredless marmalade or jam, ice cream, custard, clear jelly, butter, margarine. 

The hospital also instructed me to start taking Moviprep, one packet (A + B) at 7pm Wednesday evening; and then another packet (A+B) starting from 6am Thursday. On each occasion I was told to drink the mixture at 250ml a time over 1 to 2 hours. On each occasion I was also to take 500ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels &ndash; non-diet carbonated drinks i.e. Coca Cola, Lucozade, or ginger ale, any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice (but NOT other fruit juices); water alone not being sufficient. A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked.

On Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets (A + B) with 1 litre of water in a large jug. It tasted mildly of lemon but, because of warnings about taste, I downed each 250ml in seconds (rather than sip it) so as not to have to agonise over the taste. Starting at 7am the fourth dose was finished at 8pm. The drug started having an effect at about 7.45pm and thereafter it was a matter of getting to the lavatory frequently and quickly for about 3 to 4 hours. I went to bed at midnight but had to get up again at 2am and two more occasions up to 4am; though not in so much of a hurry. I took the 500ml of water after the final dose and about 250ml of Lucozade after that.  I was also told to use, what we in the UK, call vaseline to prevent soreness of skin on the buttocks. This I did not do but regretted it. Just before midnight I was so sore that I did apply some vaseline ready for Thursday morning and it paid dividends. 

On Thursday morning I went through the same procedure again applying the vaseline again before starting. This time the emissions were yellow and eventually pretty clear. Also the emissions pretty much (though not entirely) finished by 8am, much quicker than the night before. I can only assume there was nothing left to eject. All in all it was not a pleasant chore but a fair price to pay to get the job done.",UNK

I am only 42 yrs old and fear being crippled due to this nasty disease.  I am hoping this medicine will continue to work for me.  Hydrocodone 5-325 just wasn&#039;t cutting it for me anymore, needed something stronger as the pain was getting truly unbearable.  I would recommend others to try it.  I&#039;ve read a lot of reviews and have seen mixed reviews but for the most part others are happy with the results like myself.",UNK
221,"I was hesitant to take this, but a persistent cough and chronic bronchitis that was well into week 9 left me little choice.  I am typically sensitive to most medications.  Especially stimulants which is why I was so hesitant.  However - I noticed a near immediate suppression of my coughing attacks which would leave me breathless and gasping to the point I was almost vomitting.  It took about 30 mins but I noticed it, and will be taking this again in the future if I have an option to!",UNK

Thank you to the makers of this medicine. It seems to work!",UNK
223,"I was prescribed this for Anxiety never should have had such strong medication for that as it controls seizures and brain injurys. My physical health&amp; nerves were fine before this. Nuerontin destroyed the nerves in my hands&amp; feet&amp; gave me Peripheral&amp; Axonal Neuropathy. Ironically its used to treat these nerve conditions but because my nerves were fine before taking it,It did the opposite and destroyed the nerves in my hands&amp; feet destroying my life. Have been disabled 8 yrs for trusting my Dr and the damage is irreversable. Drs shouldn&#039;t use patientz as guinea pigs and pharmaceutical companies should not  e allowed to give medication not intended for medical conditions.I have lost 8 yrs of my life due to this medication and am not diabetic.",UNK
224,"I started taking Adipex 37.5 on May 29th, my first time taking this medication but I can&#039;t seem to lose any of my weight gained from my second pregnancy. I tried dieting, exercising and nothing happened. My current weight when I started was 248 and the first day taking this I felt like If I started moving I wouldn&#039;t be able to stop. The energy it provides was amazing. So far the only side effects I&#039;ve had was dry mouth. Starting to get a little constipated but I knew that was a possibility so I&#039;m prepared for it.  I weighed myself today and I&#039;m down to 241. I haven&#039;t changed my eating habits and I try to stay active for at least 30 minutes a day. I&#039;m hoping to lose between 50-70lbs.",UNK

But it&#039;s been about a week now and I can definitely say that I love it so far! Haven&#039;t had any side effects besides really bad nausea on the second day of the pill. But everything was fine after that. Haven&#039;t experienced any mood swings, decrease in sex drive. I&#039;ve noticed that my appetite did increase just a little and my breasts have been more tender than usual.",UNK
226,"Overall experience is ok. My mix: refrigerated suprep, slightly chilled water, ginger ale. Drink as fast as you can.  After gulping down as much as you can simply suck on a lemon to get rid of the taste.  Continue process and it&#039;ll be over quickly.  The second bottle in the morning is tougher.  Might be because your stomach is not expanded and chugging the solution plus two more 16oz bottles of water is really filling.  It started working for me 20min after drinking.  Be sure to get wet wipes.  BTW there&#039;s no pain with the bathroom part of it, not like an upset stomach, it takes surprisingly little effort for the bowel movement.  Good luck",UNK

HOWEVER, I had extreme side effects: taste change, extreme mood &amp; behavior change, tingling fingers/toes/lips, dizziness, vomiting, and increased eye pressure. I had to be taken off of it and put on Elavil. Like I said, as far as the migraine prevention it was perfect but it came with a price that my doctor and I thought was not worth it.",UNK

238,"I started taking this drug for chronic daily headaches in 1999.  Turns out they were caused by stress &amp; serious depression.  The Serzone was a miracle drug for me!  I saw the world so much more clearly and without the negative lens.  My headaches were gone (turns out it actually has a patent for preventing migraines!).  I was on it for 8 years until I moved to a new city and had trouble finding doctors to write for it.  So I was off it the last two years, and my doctor had me on awful Depakote instead.  I hated it!  I found a doctor this week to put me back on Nefazodone (Serzone).  I look forward to ramping up the dosage and feeling alive again!  It was a great drug for me without sexual side effects, which is important to many men.",UNK

241,I have interstitial cystitis have taken hyophen on three separate occasions (1-4 days at a time) and it only helped once.  My bladder felt painfully full even immediately after urinating and it helped  the second time I took it for a few days before my bladder calmed down.  The other two times it did nothing.  Very similar symptoms but no relief.  I don&#039;t understand and just want some help.,UNK

Acne has been pretty bad, didn&#039;t know why that was either (don&#039;t usually have acne). For a few weeks now my body feels like it is pregnant.

Although my psoriasis is not what they class as severe it effects my world in a severe way as it is on visual parts of my body that are difficult to hide (especially in summer). Elocon was the first ointment to take the red appearance from the psoriasis and also make some areas look normal again. It has lost its inflammatory appearance and is lessoning in size. I would highly recommend others to give it a go. ,UNK

I have been using hot packs as well as following my prescribed dose of clindamycin and in 3 days time most of the swelling has gone down and the abscess is bout half of the size of originally was. I&#039;m only giving it an 8 because I haven&#039;t finished the 7 day script yet but I&#039;m hoping things will continue to heal up and go down and will be mostly or all the way gone but so far it seems the clindamycin is working well for me.,UNK

I Underwent 4 1/2 months of chemo with minimal shrinkage to existing tumors but did stunt the growth of the tumors. At that point my tumors were considered inoperable.

I sat up after it was over and started sweating, my ears started to ring and I then passed out! When I woke up I was in the worst pain I have ever felt. I drove myself to the doctor but I had to have someone come get me because I couldn&#039;t even stand up. The rest of the day I had extreme cramping.

I am awakened at night because of the pain and I can&#039;t turn over in bed.  I am constantly achey and tired.  Before Prolia, I was extremely active.  I worked with a personal trainer twice a week for six months, before the 2nd injection, but now, I have probably lost all the muscle, strength and flexibility I gained.  I put my gym membership on hold, until I can move, again, without pain. Prolia is the worst!!!!!",UNK

Psychiatrist, group talk but your the only one who knows what you feel others do not understand it. I have always been a deep person and would think way to much. I got out of that stage on my own. Trust me it sucks i still get &quot;crazy&quot; but on Paxil it really helped me I only take Paxil nothing else. You name it I was on it schizophrenia meds as well.

It&#039;s been three months that I&#039;ve been on my period, and the constant bleeding caused a bacterial infection which then led to problems with UTIs. I am miserable, but my doctor made me sign an agreement saying I couldn&#039;t get it removed because of period problems, so now I&#039;m stuck. I would not suggest this product to anyone who plans on having sex in the next six months or doesn&#039;t want to pay to constantly buy pads or tampons.

Persistent usage of this antibotic is imperative for skin clarity. I noticed no improvement in my skin color/inflamatory symptoms until after a month of usage.

When I was upset I would have anxiety attacks and black out. When I was angry I was uncontrollable sometimes even physical with my love ones. The sad part is I did not even know they were happening or happened until they told me. I wish I had gotten help sooner but now I am grateful and blessed for Lexapro and therapy. Every medicine is not right for everyone so you need to find the one that fits you along with therapy.,UNK

I was feeling hopeless, stressed, accussing my boyfriend constantly of being negligent. I was taking prozac before and it worked but made me tired and I blacked out when I drank. With brintillex I skip it if I drink and have plenty of energy and no issues.

However my psychiatrist put me on klonopin to help ease the anxiety and it has been amazing. I only need .25 mg 2 to 3 times a day, but it gave me the ability to function. Even with withdrawal from Paxil and start up side effects from Zoloft, I can still keep my head straight.

We drove to the store and I took the pill within 20-30 minutes after the mishap. After reading these reviews (much like some of you panicking right now) it really helped me to feel better. A week later, on my usual day, I got my period! I experienced some nausea, headaches, tender breasts and weird moods but it didn&#039;t help that I was already suffering from a minor cold.

Have tried many antibiotics,  but Ceftin works the best with the least side effects. I agree with other comments. After only 2 doses of a 10 day course I already felt 50% better. I am an RN and I have seen Zpak and Augmentin fail people during sinusitis treatment. This drug is my go-to now. It truly cures the infection. I only get maybe one acute sinusitis per year now, thanks to this drug.",UNK

It works wonderfully, but I surely wouldn&#039;t want to have a blackout and end up driving. Is there any class action suit against this drug?

So I asked my doctor for a low hormone bcp. I was skeptical at first because of my past experiences with the pill but I love it.

Another strange thing was it gave me little red bumps all over my face that weren&#039;t acne but just texture.

Suicides were above average for people taking these in combination. Just saying, it&#039;s excellent on its own.  I disagree with the DEA.

I also started to gain weight and THE HORROR... ACNE TOO! I told my OBGYN and we are going to try other method.

I wasn&#039;t concerned about any redness in my skin, as it wasn&#039;t bad, but I was assured it would take care of the pimple-like bumps that had persisted for years.  I tried it for two weeks and there was no improvement.....just got a little worse.  It also dried out my skin, so had to use extra moisturizers. No terrible side effects, so rating it a 2.

Ambien and Trazadone where my go to combo and worked well for me aside from the restorative part. Hence, the move to Belsomra. I started with 10mg  and it did nothing. Then I tried 20mg and it did assist with falling asleep eventually (at least 2 hours), but not staying asleep. I sleep off and on with this stuff and the dreams are pretty consistent, definitely not REM sleep. To anyone thinking of trying this drug, I&#039;d say save your money and keep looking.",UNK

Took about an hour for coughing to calm down after taking. First night I coughed quite a bit but on the next 100 mg dose cough got better. Do not be discouraged if it does not work right away.

339,"I have tried the pill, the patch, nuvaring, patch and the depo shot. I have to say the IUD has been my favorite! I did like the depo a lot but I broke out with a lot of acne all over my face. I never had acne as a teenager so getting it as an adult was torture and humiliating. I had to see a dermatologist and get on accutane. I then got the IUD in May 2011. I was nervous after reading reviews but decided I&#039;d give it a shot anyway. Getting it inserted, I didn&#039;t realize how badly it hurt...after 30 days it felt great! I did have to get it trimmed once since my husband did hit it a few times. Other than that I highly recommend it. Best birth control I&#039;ve tried by far! Give it a chance :)",UNK
340,"I would never recommended as a birth control. I got it in 2014 I just got to take it out today in 2017. For the past year-and-a-half I&#039;ve been so sick. I&#039;ve been seen special doctors got my gallbladder taken out, and been on many medications because they could never figure out what was truly wrong with me. I had cramping horribly bad and heavy  periods, nausea, vomiting, upset stomach. Always felt like I had morning sickness. Fatigue, brain fog. Finally I saw a link on a website saying how paragard has really bad side effects thank God I clicked on that. I have 85% of all side effects. Found out that the copper on this has been going to my bloodstream and I have what&#039;s called copper toxicity. Way too much copper in my body.",UNK

I come from the medical field, lab and had seen people come in for blood work on everything from lithium to thorazine.  I have (with M.D. agreement) backed down from 500mg ER Depokote, to 250mg ER every evening along with a sleeping pill. The sleeping pill is new, so next time I will give the name.  When &quot;they&quot; found me, I was so gone into what we call our &quot;BLACK HOLE&quot;. I truly have no idea what all they tried....BUT the Depakote, according to my wife (Nurse for 34 yrs)
was my marriage and life saver.",UNK
342,"I took this medicine for about 3 years. About 6 months ago, my dosage was increased from 20 mg to 40 mg. At first there were no problems. After a couple of months, I started having shortness of breath, chest pain, tremors, fatigue and vomiting. I went to the ER with chest pains and shortness of breath. They could find nothing wrong with my heart. I was sent to a cardiologist to have Holter monitoring, echocardiagram and stress test. Nothing. Had a pulmonary function test. Nothing. The pravastatin brought my cholesterol down to 177, so my doctor took me off of it to see if it made any difference with all my health problems. It did. Within 3 days I was starting to feel better. Within a week I was back to my old self again.",UNK

I also have insomnia which is the only thing it&#039;s helped for. I actually sleep but it gives me dry mouth and once I woke up and everything was spinning for the whole day. ",UNK
344,Have been taking staxyn for about two years. The first 6 months it worked amazing. 3 or 4 times a night was no problem. Slowly have found a tolerance builds up and now it only works about half as well as it did before. My side effects are a very stuffy nose and head ache.I usually use a nose spray after taking it and also take a Tylenol.  This way no plugged nose and no headache,UNK
345,"After having to pay a but load out of pocket for this i slowly found out it was not for me. It put me in a hyper-manic state. Had to constantly be moving. Would wake up every morning at 7 am, when the sunlight started peaking in my room, regardless of what time I was finally able to pass out. And worst of all, it caused me to have problems using the restroom. No matter how hard I tried or what I did it made me not able to urinate. Some meds don&#039;t work on some people as they should.",UNK
346,I started taking 5 mg amlodipine about two months ago.  My blood pressure is still 140/90 and my body aches from the waist down.

They haven&#039;t and seem to be getting worse.  I&#039;m going to call him again this week,UNK
347,Highly effective when taken for restless legs syndrome. I only need 1/2 of a 2.5mg pill. I take 1/4th of it one hour before I can tell I&#039;ll get the RLS symptoms then the other part at bedtime.,UNK
348,I had the skyla put in 3months ago. I have to say I was excited about getting it. The only thing now is that I&#039;m experiencing the weight gain. I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m going to keep it long I do not like the extra weight. I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;m going to have to diet more or exercise more but it is beginning to be annoying to me. I&#039;m going to give it a couple more months to see if I can gain some control over my issue if it doesn&#039;t change I&#039;m going to consider removing it.,UNK

350,"I have had hives my entire life.  I finally saw an allergist and he did tests.  He took me off of all medicines and put me on Xyzal.  I took the Xyzal three times and I have not had a hive since.  Seriously.  I had my first hives at 4 months and had hives everyday for forty six years.  I do not know what Xyzal did but it fixed me.  I stopped taking Claritin and Benadryl and Zyrtec.  Took Xyzal for three days.  It made me VERY sleepy.  I can&#039;t even take a normal Benadryl dose without falling asleep, though.  I had to take liquid Benadryl, one teaspoon, if I wanted to stay awake.  I slept twelve hours with my first dose of Xyzal and about 8 hours with the two successive doses.  Then, I never had a hive again.",UNK

That &#039;I Don&#039;t Want to Get Out of Bed and Face Yet Another Horrible Day -- I Just Want to Give Up&#039; type of depression. Wellbutrin, for me, erases those bad feelings and does so very quickly. Within 4 hours of my first dose my confidence came surging back. The rapidity of action is due to the unique way it works; it isn&#039;t the typical antidepressant.

Wellbutrin has side effects, but none harsh enough to stop me from taking it regular. The side effects I experience is (a.) a tense feeling (physically), and (b.) kind of a &#039;chemical taste&#039; in my mouth. But, there&#039;s no blurred vision, no zombie feeling and no terribly dry mouth. The payoff is worth it.",UNK

Thankful to be rid of headaches but wish the doctor would help!",UNK

I hesitated to take any statins because I got a rash from Lipitor but finally agreed to take Crestor because last summer my stress test showed abnormalities (which were later disproven).  

However, I started on only 5mg, I started walking about 20 -30 minutes a day a few times a week and now 8 months later my total cholesterol was BELOW normal and all other levels were within a good range and my endocrinologist was very pleased and said no reason to go up to 10 mg.

357,"When my doctor first prescribed gabapentin, normally a seizure medicine, for my anxiety, I was a little confused. She explained to me that if you look at 2 brain scans, one patient with seizures, and one with anxiety, the damage in their brain is very similar.

Within a week, I was able to feel a dramatic difference with my anxiety. Within a month, I truly felt &quot;normal&quot; again. I LOVE what this medication does for me, and it&#039;s made a huge impact on my daily life.

358,Just got marina inserted today. Was on bc for years tried pill patch etc. Hubby then got snip which failed but we are delighted with our little bundle of joy. Really did not know what to expect and was very nervous about insertion. I took ponston before hand and it did not hurt. Measurement went fine then when inserted felt something but very mild. Not like some reviews. So far so good but dont have it long enough to comment on side effects. Insertion not as bad as i expected. Will update in a few months time,UNK
359,"I just has Distal bicep surgery, extremely painful. The injury that lead up to surgery was painful. Doctor put me on Percocet 5/325 then my surgeon gave me Vicodin after the repair, well this did nothing. Went back to the Percocet, pain gone within 20-30 minutes.

361,"I started this injectible over a a year ago and am stopping it on my doctor&#039;s advice.  After all the usual start up symptoms went away after a few weeks, the medication did seem to work, but as time went on it seemed to not work as well. Also, my hair started to thin out and fall out, mildly, and I have Tinnitus and it definitely made it worse, making it very loud. I also started having problems with my liver, gastritis and my thyroid has almost completely stopped working, so now I have to be on Synthroid! Make sure your doctor checks your thyroid at times.TO THE LADY WITH THE NEW STENTS= I have fourteen stents, no problem whatsoever. I also found it helped with the weakness if I ate first thing in the morning.",UNK
362,"I was taking Aviane before and transferred my prescription to a different pharmacy. There they gave me lutera since they did not have aviane... Worst experience of my life. Constant headaches and acne were the main symptoms right before my period. Extremely painful periods as well. If you are experiencing these symptoms while on lutera, I would highly recommend trying aviane. I do not have any headaches or acne and my periods are pain free.",UNK
363,"I have a son that has struggled with an attention problem in school since kindergarden. He is now 11 years old. We tried everything not to put him on medication. The homework struggle and impulsiveness became too much for us to handle, and we finally agreed to try something. His doctor told us about a new ADHD medication called Vyvanse. Believe this or not, it was like magic the first day. He was able to get all his work done in class, and went from a A,B,C student to all A&#039;s and one B in one quarter. We have the report cards to prove it. The side effects are minimal and for him the 30mg works great. I encourage anyone battling this problem to ask their childs doctor about Vyvanse. It has changed by sons life as well as ours.",UNK
364,before my body adjusted i had really bad mood swings. when my first cycle on the pill came around it was a little unsettling to say the least. bad cramping. inconsistent dark blood. menstruation is no longer a hassle though as its practically stopped completely. no mood swings. no change in appetite. less acne. you might not match this pill if you continue to yeild undesirable results.,UNK
365,This medication has been a life saver for me.  I usually bleed so bad that I can&#039;t go anywhere when I have my period. I flood the whole time!  My doctor prescribed this for my Disney Trip.

I was doing Zumba 3 times a week and had a personal trainer to help tone my body with my new found ENERGY. The Personal Trainer was a waste because Adipex with Zumba was doing a tremendous job all on its own. I wasn&#039;t craving sweets thanks to Adipex. I cut out fast foods, carbs, and late night eating. Plus I drank anywhere from 1/2 to a gallon A DAY! However, the medicine still made me constipated. I started at 244 and got down to 209lbs. I stopped using it for about 5 months AND THE WEIGHT STAYED OFF, while not eating so healthy. ",UNK

I had severe cramping/abdominal pain for the entirety of the time I was using the ring. They were so bad that I took time off from work because I could not stand up. I bled almost constantly the entire time, and it was very heavy spotting, heavier than I had ever had from a period before using the ring. I bled heavily during and after intercourse. 

After the cramps became unbearable and I could not stand bleeding as heavily as I was I decided to come off nuva ring. It took my body seven months to stop bleeding heavily. I had heavy periods for two weeks at a time as my body readjusted. And even now my periods last longer than they did before using the ring. I also have spotting in between periods, and I never had spotting before using the ring.

As a moderate to heavy drinker, he did not advise me that this is used to pull people from the disease.

I loved the benefits, but the side effects were ruining my life and relationships, so I discontinued. In addition to rage, I also experienced severe prolonged pms (3 weeks duration), constant breast pain and swelling, unrestorative sleep, and awful vivid lifelike nightmares.

This immediately made a huge difference in my skin and within 2 weeks I noticed a reduction in breakouts. I used to break out a lot during my monthly cycle and now I get maybe 1 pimple a month.

One week later I had an outbreak similar to my first, except now my buttocks and thighs were included.

If you actually wanna be a happy person without being high, this is it. 50 mg am- optional second until next day. Forget the critics.

401,"I was on the Ortho Evra patch for a couple years and after the first 3 months of your body adjusting to it, (which you are forewarned about) just regular side effects, mood swings, regular cramps (when your time is almost near) and I believe it gave me a high sex drive. I&#039;ve been off of it for about 5 months and my sex drive plummeted dramatically. It&#039;s extremely convenient due to my forgetting to take the pill everyday. I usually put it on my pelvis and rotate sides each week.",UNK

When I was on 200mcg twice a day, they were mild side effects. When I uppered the dose to 400mcg 2 times a day, the side effects were terrible. I cant deal with that kind of pain. Toooo much. Guess my dosage is gonna be 200mcg a day.its only been 2 weeks. But at least I don&#039;t get sob. I get tired cause the pain is sooo bad. Everyone is different so I would recommend it.

406,"I absolutely loved this IUD. I was skeptical at first, being that I hopped on the internet and started reading reviews and pretty much all I saw were people saying how bad the pain was getting it inserted and that the pain was worse to get it removed. The pain getting it inserted was NOT as bad as I was expecting. It literally just was a cramp that was a smidge more painful than I was use to. Besides that, the insertion was not bad. I cramped/bled for about a month then after that my periods started to slowly lighten up and now 3 years later I basically have no period (which is awesome considering before my IUD I had the worst periods). I recommend Skyla to everyone.",UNK
407,"I used to have moderate cystic acne - down my back, on my arms and of course all over my face. It was my greatest insecurity and the cause for my low self esteem. I would simply refuse to go outside without wearing layers of makeup first and would constantly pop my pimples in order to flatten them out and attempt to conceal them better with makeup- stupid, I know .
I have Accutane to thank for changing this about me. It has been my messiah. I won&#039;t claim to have picture perfect skin but after 8 months on this drug my skin is nothing like it used to be. Nowadays I don&#039;t wake up and pat my face for new breakouts , first thing in the morning filled with dread. 

Of course it is important to take this drug responsibly and keep your Derm informed",UNK

This medication has accentuated weakness, tiredness and pain which was reported to physician two months into treatment.

I needed that for a while but got concerned about not caring about much of anything. That&#039;s when I weaned myself off of that. Not too long later I realized I still had issues that needed dealt with. My doctor suggested trying wellbutrin instead as it targets different chemicals in the brain. It has made a huge difference for me in dealing with persistent depression. For the first week or two I had night sweats and very vivid nightmares along with a loss of appetite.

This medication reduced my appetite so much that at times I had to force myself to eat just to make sure I was taking in at least 1000 calories a day as directed by my doctor. I went off the medication and gained about 10 pounds back, so now I am restarting the medicine after being off a while. It&#039;s no miracle drug, but it is a great tool.",UNK

A Board Certified Internist prescribed this medicine (although there are over 100 other alternatives) for my 75-year old mother. Luckily, she is totally competent &amp; in VERY good health. BUT the smallest dose of this medicine did exactly what the manufacturer WARNS ABOUT - dizziness, sleepiness, etc. She wound up falling and the ER doctors who treated her said that if (BY PURE LUCK) I hadn&#039;t been walking directly behind her and was strong enough to catch her she would have broken hr femur or hip.  This was reported to our State Medical Board and the MD was fully investigated. Within 60 days the license was revoked.",UNK

I choose the ParaGard for that fact that it has no hormones and it last for 10 years. I just had it put in 3 days ago. It was hands down the worse pain I have ever felt in my life.  She had to clamp my uterus with a pair of forceps to keep it from moving away from her. The procedure took about 5- 10 minutes total.  After it was finished I sat up and immediately felt dizzy and lightheaded. I had to lay down for 10 minutes.  I then drove home and played in agony for about 3 hours.  After that it was bearable pain and cramping.",UNK

Only 3 meds have worked for me, and Fetzima is one of them. This drug saved my life.  The side effects slowly went away over a 6 week time period.  Yes, it is energizing at first and you may need to take an extra amount of benzo to calm you down, but the side effects eventually go away for some of us, although it seems like they never will for weeks.

Explosive, watery diarrhea, loud and almost constant gurgling in my stomach, and my bottom is so raw that I can barely sit down. I still don&#039;t feel totally cleaned out. I can&#039;t keep up this pattern - getting less than 3 hours of sleep a night (I have a stressful job and can&#039;t afford to be this tired!), and I don&#039;t dare take it in the mornings because I wouldn&#039;t be able to work at all!",UNK

I was recommended by my healthcare provider of this option since it is safe and suit with my situation. I am 27 years old now and have no kids. In the process of putting it in, it was very painful since I have never had kids, so my cervix is not as wide as ones who did. I had bad cramps for about a week and period for almost a month. Since then, I have some spotting as well as cramps. The cramp is not as bad as I used to have when I was on period. I don&#039;t think I have other side effects such as acne or weight gain. I recommend it to you. To me, it is more of psychological fix! Worry free!",UNK

I&#039;m 18 and have been dealing with depression, but this medication helped me tremendously. I was originally on Paxil, but due to sexual side effects, I switched to this and it restored my sex drive. I also have a little bit of anxiety, but this medication cleared that up as well. The first week was hard. I experienced heart palpitations, very anxious, ridiculous energy, and I was easily agitated. After the first week, those side effects slowly diminished and now I don&#039;t have them at all. That is the only reason I didn&#039;t give this medicine a 10. It saved my life. I HIGHLY recommend this to any who doesn&#039;t want sexual side effects.",UNK

I spent many years trapped in a horrible cycle of panicking any time I felt the slightest twinge of nausea, which in turn, induced intense stomach upset, sometimes to the point of heaving. I&#039;ve tried other anti-nausea medication in the past (Phenergran, Compazine), with so-so results, and the annoying side effect of extreme drowsiness. Zofran has been a real lifesaver for me. Within minutes of taking a pill, my nausea subsides. The only side effect I&#039;ve experienced has been constipation, but I&#039;ll take that over vomiting any day!

421,"This drug worked wonders for me! I had terrible insomnia, and was averaging only a few hours of sleep a night. I started taking 2mg of Lunesta a year ago. It helped me with anxiety and allowed me to get 8 hours of sleep a night.

I have always been afraid of forming a dependency on sleep aids, so after one year of using Lunesta I weaned myself off, just to put my mind to ease. It was very easy to do! I cut my pill in half for a few weeks, then stopped taking it. No withdrawal symptoms. I then decided to keep taking 1 mg but its comforting for me to know that I&#039;m not dependent on it.

My cravings are really bad, which also does not help the weight loss. I get super moody at times and I&#039;m always tired. The first few months taking it, my sex drive plummeted. I didn&#039;t want my man to touch me, look at me, I was so moody. My acne before and after my period is horrendous. The only good thing about this medication is my period is lighter. I received this medication from a Planned Parenthood clinic, I will definitely be going to a GYN next month to change this.",UNK

The patch hasn&#039;t made too much of a difference in that area but my skin is clear &amp; I&#039;m definitely protected from pregnancy.  The first two months my period was really bad but it got better. I&#039;m happy with the patch and I recommend it.  One downside is the color of it though. I&#039;m African American so my skin is brown and the patch is kind of pink like a Bandaid. No big deal though.,UNK

However, I&#039;ve had a fantastic experience with Mirena so far.  Spotted for 1.5 days (not months - DAYS) with only mild cramping.  Intercourse after 3 days, and it was as enjoyable, if not more so than before.

As I understand, it&#039;s better to have had children before using Mirena.  I can see why - insertion would likely have been more painful had I not had 1 child.

I had cramps the whole time I was spotting. I ended up getting my period a week before it was scheduled to start. My period normally lasts 6 or 7 days, but it was only 4 days after using this pill.

It worked, but my only problem with it was that it made her period a little late so that whole time we were just wondering if it didn&#039;t work. It still worked tho, regardless of some of the comments saying Plan-B was better. In retrospect I would&#039;ve just gotten Plan-B for the extra $10 for the more positive assurance.",UNK

I took my first dose around noon, and by 2pm had a pounding headache. As the day continued, I began to have tremors and convulsions, blurred vision and was very disoriented. At 10 pm my heart rate and breathing were very rapid and I had mild hallucinations. I rode it out for the rest of the night and after about 3 hours most of the side effects had faded with the exception of the headache. Unfortunately, the worst side effects was yet to come, graphic vivid nightmares. My doctor took me off the medication, after one dose, three days ago. ",UNK

I had weird symptoms and I didn&#039;t think it was time for my period so I called my gyno and she said I was probably fine but just take a pregnancy test (I was concerned my IUD shifted). The pregnancy test was positive so we knew something was very wrong so ended up in ER with an ectopic pregnancy and a huge ovarian cyst. I had emergency surgery to remove my Fallopian tube. I had the IUD for 5 months and it was not a pleasant experience, I had cramping that was severe even months after I got it put in, to the point I was hurled over. But it may have been the cyst growing.",UNK

Then at 7am there was sharp pain, when I was moving to bathroom I was going to faint, blackness was there in front of me. I couldn&#039;t stand on my feet. I poop my pants and my head struck the wall of my bathroom. Hearing this noise my mother came and made me sat on the floor and threw some water on my face then my senses came. I think no more trouble should come from this medicine now. I will never take this medicine in my life. This was the worst experience in my life. I advise you not to take this medicine.",UNK

He had condom initially but it dissappeared.He didnt notice that, so he literally came inside of my vagina. I was panic because of my irregular period cycle, I was not sure about everything.

He said it was due to dry eye issues and being around a lot of dust/debris, which made sense at the time. The antibiotic drops did the trick, but I was told to keep using Lastacaft, and sure enough, the redness returned. I continued with the just the antibiotics and I was back to normal.

I feel super anxious and a bit paranoid, to the point of keeping me up at night. I&#039;m on my 4th day of 7 day dose, but today will be my last on this medicine. I&#039;ve decided I&#039;d rather risk getting the UTI again than deal with these side effects any longer, if it comes back I&#039;ll definitely be asking my doctor for a different antibiotic.

I do not have any irregular mood swings on this pill. I have been on it for about 3 months now, and my acne is still worse than before I got on it, not that it&#039;s a big deal.

During the first 4-5 months I lost 40 pounds, and slightly over a year later I&#039;ve gained 20 back.

Just like regular period cramps. When it was inserted, it didn&#039;t feel much different than a pap. I did feel a few cramps, which were pretty bearable. My legs started shaking during the process, but I think it&#039;s because I almost let my nerves get the best of me. My doctor explained the whole process before doing anything, which was good.

For me, the patches work better than pain pills. They are covered by my insurance at a higher co-pay. And, with each prescription, I have to go through this whole prior authorization wait period. Get samples from your doctor to test them out and make sure they work for you. If they do, then fight the insurance.

Over the past three years I&#039;ve gained quite a bit of weight and this is the only reason I&#039;m moving back to the pill. If you&#039;re worried about weight gain, do not use  Implanon.",UNK

517,It&#039;s the most effective for not falling pregnant. I heard people getting pregnant on everything but the Implanon. It&#039;s 99.9% effective. I had fun with it. No kids and all the fun you can have. I have one child when I was 16 and got the Implanon right after I had him. I was too young and need to make sure I have no more for a while. When I get in my late 20s I will have another child but for now no. I&#039;m 19 and too young.,UNK

I used to go to the bathroom 6-8 times a day (sometimes more, usually with cramps) I used to take bentyl but it makes me feel very sleepy and groggy. I took the 75mg for awhile but it became less effective so now I&#039;m on the 100mg and it works a lot better and I&#039;m down to going to the bathroom about twice a day with minimal or no cramps through out the day. The only side effect I have had is that about 10 minutes after taking the pill I feel weird, like a weird feeling, mostly in my upper back/shoulders. It goes away pretty quickly and doesn&#039;t hurt.",UNK
519,"Cymbalta 120mg for 4 months
Good:
- slight to moderate increase in motivation, mental energy and attention/alertness.
- decrease in anxiety and depressive feelings.
Bad:
- made me less social, less empathetic and more robotic.
- horrible withdrawal symptoms which happen quickly if you forget to take it.
- when my dosage was increased from 30mg to 60mg, it started to give me nightmares at night and caused me to wake up in middle of the night and lose sleep.

Conclusion: Better positive cognitive experience than 10mg Escitalopram which other than positively affecting my mood, all it did was cause constant brain fogs and decrease my motivation even further.",UNK

Did anyone else have side effects that came after two months?  Luckily this should be my last refill of this medication.

I feel like I can do anything, with a clear mind of course. I don&#039;t have to hide away anymore.

I have mild dry eye disease under normal circumstances, and dry eyes are *not* listed as a side effect for Latuda.

However, 1.5 years perfectly fine and after the first one, at about 2 years I had it replaced and all was fine again. I put on no weight (if anything I find I am probably fitter while on it but that&#039;s just lifestyle). I did put on weight on Depo the one time I tried it. It doesn&#039;t react badly with everyone - I was back in the gym within the week doing light arm stuff until the bruising went away with no ill effects. Issues with this could be doctor problems not implant problems!! I have loved it. No more forgetting to take the pill and being worried",UNK
528,I have been using this for about 6 days now and already notice a huge difference. The first few days I was very tired but it was well worth it to get rid of the skin condition that came from nowhere. I am 32 and my skin had never done this before. I am so happy that this is working and thank God that it was not an expensive medication either considering I am a widow and single mom. I would tell anyone with this problem to try this first and skip anything else. It is just an infection. Best of luck to you all.,UNK

I waited for my next period andI I only had brown discharge and very small spotting. I continued to wait and decided to take a blood test. The results showed 0 HCG and stated not pregnant.

refused to pay for it and suggested all kinds of Biologic medications.  I refused the Biologic meds after reading of dangerous side effects. Otezla approved me on a temporary Bridge program while we are fighting the Insurance. Initial results were astonishing. Both the Arthritis pain and the Psoriasis were gone!

I wondered why I had almost no interest in cigarettes any more, some days even forgetting to have a cigarette!

I was severely depressed from having to live with anxiety and fear.  A horrible and embarrassing thing to live with.  My Dr. perscribed me Celexa and I honestly didn&#039;t think it would work.  I almost gave up taking Celexa because it took 3 weeks to kick in and I am impatient.  After taking Celexa, I find that I am much calmer.

Side effects are dry mouth (solved by drinking a ton of water) and tingling in feet, which I notice more as it becomes time to take the next dose in the morning. Qsymia definitely curbed the snacking, the over eating, etc. Changed the way I eat, increased fresh vegetables, cut carbs (no bread, limited starch, etc.) and stopped eating processed foods. Began to cook dinner more, to control the butter, oil, cooking method rather than relying on the quick fix of takeout. This has made a HUGE difference. Increased activity as well.

On the day I was due my period, I suffered abdominal pains which I wouldn&#039;t have associated with cycle pains. When my period didn&#039;t come, that is when I started frantic researching; reading forums can be very scary and stress you out even more. I had a tendency to latch onto negative experiences.

I feel 50x better and this mild post-pill/post BM discomfort is definitely worth it given the huge relief. 6-12 hours to work? More like 1.5-2.

The people who are feeding you these nightmare precipitated withdrawal stories are getting the shot with opiates still in their system. Obviously, the more and longer you use, the longer it may take for you to get completely opiate free. But 10-14 days is long enough for nearly anybody.

(I&#039;m slender, always ate a well-balanced diet, and exercised.)  I tried various medications but the side effects outweighed an pain relief.   I have been on Gabapentin (neurontin) 200mg at night for four years.  It doesn&#039;t relieve all pain, but it does allow me to sleep through the night.  I wake up every morning in pain, which continues on and off all day.  However, I have very little side effect (occasional sadness, irritability, nausea).   Neurontin allows me to have a reasonable quality of life, and very inexpensive.",UNK

These have helped to limit the number of attacks; however, I do still have them about twice a month.  When my symptoms start, without Levsin SL I am in agony for anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours; with the Levsin SL, my symptoms come to a dead stop within five minutes of taking it.  The plain (not sublingual) tablets take a little longer to work, but they are still better than suffering for over an hour.  I don&#039;t understand how the FDA determined it was ineffective.",UNK

I&#039;m now back at 50 mg and feel even keel.  It has been humbling for me to admit that I need this medication and I dislike how it makes you feel dependent on it, but I also realize it is doing its job.  I have lost 5-10 pounds since starting it.  The first few weeks I was in a fog and suffered horrible headaches and nausea, but per my doctor&#039;s words those symptoms did subside.  I&#039;ve not had a single panic attack since starting Zoloft.  ",UNK
579,My son is 13 and was put on Focalin for his ADHD when he was about 7 years old. It did not make him a zombie at all. My ex=husband was very concerned that it would do what Ritalin did to him. Focalin for my son just calmed him down enough to do his class work . He was first just taking one in the mornings and then as he got older and got more class work to do we realized that it was not lasting him so he got put on a low does for in the afternoon.

The only side effect I have had is a little dizziness when I get up too fast. But I feel great and am on day 4 and down to 20mg of hydros and still feel good! Like I never started them.

In a new relationship and questioned by my partner about my inconsolable sense of unhappiness, I realized I needed to try something other than running away so in a last ditch move, signed up for a depression study that has given me 6 mos of Zoloft medication.

My boobs didn&#039;t get any bigger. My periods are always right on schedule and never heavy but the rest of the month is a roller coaster with my emotions, weight, etc.",UNK

I haven&#039;t had as bad of racing thoughts while I&#039;m trying to fall asleep and I end up sleeping like a baby. The after effects is a little bit of groggyness but it&#039;s worth it. The only thing that bothers me is that I feel like smoking cigarettes after I take it. Overall, it&#039;s great and stops the mania as well as depression.",UNK
635,"Hot sweats were the thing most mentioned and most noticeable. My apologies for lack of empathy to all those who I&#039;ve known going through them.
Muscle mass loss and decreased exercise tolerance.  My total weight lifted in a usual work out fell to about 1/3.
Dry scaling skin and increased dry hair. However, my creeping male pattern baldness was certainly less noticeable.
Testicular size and libido took a hit.",UNK
636,"As someone who uses Zyrtec as one of 2 primary treatments (The other being Benadryl.) I can vouch that Zyrtec gets the job done as described. 24 hours of itch free and low-drowsiness is very suitable for me. If you are someone having withdrawals from Zyrtec then you don&#039;t take it right. It only occurs when your body needs the Zyrtec in order for your brain to be chemically balanced. This usually occurs if you take it based on a schedule rather then when you notice your real symptoms.

I have some health concerns that lead my doctor to prescribe this for me. My doctor helped to administer the first dose so I would know what to do the next day. 
I felt okay the first 2 days with little side effects. The 3rd day I couldn&#039;t stand the smell of bacon. Who doesn&#039;t like the smell of bacon? This girl now! The 4th day I threw up my morning coffee and meds. I have been experiencing constipation as well. I am currently on 1.2mg and on day 9. I&#039;ve lost 5 lbs so far so I&#039;ll keep dealing with the side effects. I did start to inject at night to help with the nausea. I am very hopeful this medication will do the job!",UNK
638,"So far so good. Im on my 2nd day. NO side effects..that I am aware of. I did sleep a little harder last night..lol. I just found this and read some of the other reviews, but I honestly haven&#039;t noticed anything real abnormal. This is my 1st time taking it. I am usually given bactrim for uti&#039;s because I am highly allergic to penicillin. I usually dont have fever or severe pain with a uti, but I think I have had one for a while now due to other uti symptoms. So i dont think bactrim has been working. I do not have a regular doctor (cant afford it), and I feel awful having to constantly go to the ER...only to end up STILL having a UTI. I just hope this finally gets rid of it. Im tired of spending $$ on antibiotics only for it to not work.",UNK

640,"Ritalin LA: I have taken this (10mg) along with &quot;normal&quot; release methylphenidate/Ritalin to treat narcolepsy for about 4 years.  The LA does not give me the jittery feeling of the short acting Ritalin.  I only supplement the LA with the short acting because the LA keeps me awake (or at least doesn&#039;t offer restful sleep) for about 8 hours, while the short acting version lasts about 4 hours.  Without these medications, particularly Ritalin LA, I would not be able to maintain any job that requires its employees to stay awake...which is pretty much all of them!  The only downside is the excessive cost.  Without insurance, about 10% of my gross salary would go to pay for this ONE prescription.",UNK
641,"I struggled with intense pain and bleeding due to a fissure for several months. Assuming it was hemmorhoids, I tried multiple over the counter medicines, but nothing worked. My OB/Gyn was the one who realized it was a fissure and prescribed Rectiv. The headaches were rough at first, and I almost quit using the ointment because of them. I&#039;m so glad I didn&#039;t, though. Within one week, the headaches were gone, and my fissure symptoms were calming down. By week two, I was totally back to normal--no pain, no bleeding. I continued using it for another week, just to be sure I was completely healed. I&#039;ve been off it for two weeks now, and I&#039;m still symptom-free.

I pushed for the paraguard because this will be my last try with BC. Have tried pills (the worse ever) , the implant and nuvaring all bad side effects. After reading dramatic reviews from women I expected the worse pain ever. The whole process took maybe 10 minutes and did not hurt me at all my doctor numbed my cervix I did get super high from it but it was so funny my doctor distracted me having me use my phone and I couldn&#039;t believe it was over. with a great doctor insertion should NOT hurt.",UNK

I was apprehensive of the pain due to horror stories that seem to be everywhere. DO NOT BELIEVE THE FEAR!
First of all, I have a male gynaecologist. If you&#039;re unsure about a male, have no fear! Mine was amazing and spoke frankly but honestly and really comforted me. I had been advised to take 15mg of Murelax and some ibprofen. Although I had taken the Murelax as directed (1 hour prior) my nerves were still extremely high. My gynaecologist, he said he would administer a local anaesthetic to my cervix. This really spiked my anxiety.

The ENTIRE procedure was done in about 3 minutes. It was really a 2/10 &quot;pain&quot; and more discomfort. I&#039;ve had appendicitis &amp; the implanon. This was a walk in the park!",UNK

Suddenly my entire forhead is covered in pimples. I was put on this pill because I got my period every 5 days and it lasted for 6-11 days.

It&#039;s been about 5 months of hair loss and I am to the point my husband last night noticed my hair line is receding and I&#039;ve lost about 70% of my hair.

I can live with all of these &quot;side effects&quot; as I guess you would call it.  But the one that I haven&#039;t gotten used to which happens to be the worst one for me and that is dizziness.  Its not an everyday thing but its happened twice now in 2 weeks, twice in a week. The first time it lasted for most of the day, the second time it was just in the morning.

About a year after I had developed a faster heart rate during my panic attacks and I started seeing my pulse pounding on my neck.  I still used it and thought that it was probably a new health condition. After going to several cardiac test, nothing was found wrong with my heart.

Many of us are being weaned off medicines like Cymbalta and others and these can be causing the side effects. Coming off Cymbalta can cause dizziness, feeling &quot;weird&quot; and many others.  Before you write off Savella, make sure your side effects are not withdrawal from other medicines.  I have found if I take Savella on an empty stomach, I am nauseated, so take with food. I also have moved the second dose of the day to 2 pm and that helped decrease the insomnia.  I have more energy than before, but find I am a bit edgy at times and this is fading. Smaller doses may help side effects. Insurance should cover-ask for appeal if denied.",UNK

659,Ladies do not do what I did and read all these reviews and freak yourself out! When I got my iud placed they gave me a pill to help open up my cervix so it would be less painful. I was so terrified to get it done due to the horrifying reviews. I finally got up the courage to finally have the doctor do it. Ladies it was nothing! They put the clamp on my cervix which didn&#039;t feel great but it wasn&#039;t ungodly painful. The actual insertion took like 30 seconds and then it was done. I felt a cramp but not worse than the ones I get before I&#039;m about to start. After it was done I had mild cramping for an hour then nothing. I also had no spotting at all. Please remember pain is subjective and don&#039;t let a terrible review stop you from getting it.,UNK
660,After several years of regular constipation and laxative use my doctor prescribed Amitiza. I took it at 6 and by 10:30 it was working.

I know this caused it because it was the only thing I was taking and my doctor agrees with me.  He said it is a side effect of cholesterol medicines with some people. I would rather have my hair than low cholesterol. It is a gradual loss that takes a few months to show up. Afraid to try any other brands for fear they will do the same thing.",UNK

It is amazing already how calm and patient I am with my kids and husband. I had been on other meds in the past for depression, but hadn&#039;t taken anything in a few years. I have to say for the last post, the Yaz can make you depressed and gain weight. I would have just done the Zoloft. Loving the Zoloft. Excited to see how I feel when the side effects go away.",UNK

I got dizzy and clammy and almost passed out. Thankfully my best friend was with me and was able to talk me through it and drive my ass around for the day. The after cramps weren&#039;t unbearable, but still very uncomfortable. I only spotted for a few days afterwards. Last week was a breeze. I had no problems at all. Last night I started feeling cramping, like I was dreaming and could feel them in my dreams. I woke up this morning and the cramps were super intense. I got to work and too about 1,000 mg of ibuprofen because they were bad.",UNK

Do not know what to expect but am so far very pleased with my decision! Would definitely recommend!
STOP reading reviews! I did and I got super scared and almost didn&#039;t go through with it. Every body is different but recommend you carry pain meds w you if worried about pain during procedure",UNK

The plus side for me on this pill is my mood swings are gone. It really balances me out. Recently I went to the doctor for a check up, and she suggested a new birth control pill that will aloud me to only have 2 day periods verses the 4 day ones I have with Sprintec, but also, I wouldn&#039;t get the sore breasts, etc., plus it is a lower dose. A week &amp; half into it, I was mad at the world and depressed. I am now back on Sprintec. I&#039;d take sore boobs &amp; headache over mood swings any day!",UNK

I&#039;m thankful that I haven&#039;t had the headaches, or dizziness.  I have been extremely tired and hoping that this will soon pass.

This continued on for the rest of the night. Today, I feel better, just a little abdominal cramping, but nothing that interferes with my day to day activities.

I&#039;ve probably have had it in for 20 mins now and it is just the worst!!!! I have only had a yeast infection one other time and my doctor prescribed me some prescription yeast infection cream. It never ever itched or felt this way! I never felt it, at all.

My neurologist has tried many medications, and finally Cambia! Cambia is by far the best thing I have used- If I can take it as soon as I feel the migraine coming on, it works great! I have been taking it for 6 months, and only a couple of times it didn&#039;t work. I also started taking 400mg of magnesium glycinate every day and I feel it has also helped in migraine prevention.

I started with .25 mg last night and will again tonight, then .50 for the next week and another slight increase. I&#039;m hoping that&#039;s what will help me avoid the sickness. Because once I read some of the reviews, I was pretty scared to take it. So...I took it last night and I slept better than I have in a long time. I could literally feel my body relax and I barely moved all night, which never happens! I woke up in a good mood, well rested and not groggy!  I&#039;m so thrilled!",UNK
686,Well I have had the implant for a little over 2 months. I have been bleeding 6 out of the 9 weeks I have been on this. I got the implant because of my endometriosis and heavy painful bleeding. The second month I was cramping for 5 days before I even started my period and today marks the 26th day I have been spotting and bleeding.  Right now I&#039;m frustrated because I have become anemic and I&#039;m tired of bleeding and cramping.,UNK

688,"Had it for years and love it. Changed it out after not having a period for years and boy it was painful. My first Mirena was nearly painless - just a little tuck. This time it stabbed me hard a few times (quite painful)  but each time it was over in seconds. I had menstrual cramps for an hour and that was it. I didn&#039;t even get my bleeding back (just a little right afterwards). Yeah! May advice:
 if you choose the Mirena be patient - the first year I constantly bleed off and on but then my period disappeared. Find a doctor who has done this a lot - I believe experience is the key! Also - have it done when your cervix is dilated during your period. I took Misoprostol for that the night before but that did not help.",UNK

I feel spaced out &amp; every morning I wake up &amp; want to stop taking the meds because of how I feel. I am not like &quot;myself&quot; BUT, I didnt like myself to begin with, I suffered from panic attacks that last for days on end with only relief from Xanax.

Day 8 of Bactrim I developed vaginal bleeding but made no connection.  Day 9 I stopped it. And day 10 I was blown up in hives, severe body rash, terrible chill w hi fever and a severe migraine attack. I was livid. They scared me to death. I felt I was dying. I was on Benadryl for 24 hours and started getting better. But the next day the MRSA WAS BACK. I nearly lost it!

Clear headed, no anxiety, no side affects other than mild nausea, and that ONLY if I take it on an empty stomach.  Don&#039;t miss a dose though, it will make you REALLY woozy.  Stopped for a few months, fell into depression, but Pristiq pulled me right back up when I started back.  Remember that the Rx says specifically that you may need 4 weeks to notice an improvement.  Bear that in mind when you read all these reviews by people who quit taking it after 1 or 2 days.",UNK
696,As I live in Australia minocycline is cheap - it only costs $10 for 60 pills. I was diagnosed with papulopustular rosacea by a dermatologist. I&#039;d always had a slight redness on the cheeks and slight redness under the skin of my nose but over a 6 week period many tiny pustules emerged and the redness got worse. Went to a dermatologist and he gave me the diagnosis and prescribed Soolantra indicating that it would take weeks/months to work. I didn&#039;t want to wait that long so I did extensive research on the internet and made the decision to ignore him and go to a GP and go on Minocycline 2 days later. Best decision I ever made. The Minocycline at 50mg a day made the pustules go away in only 2 weeks and the redness has significantly decreased.,UNK

The first application didn&#039;t burn at all but it itched like crazy around like 4am when I woke up and the same for the next application. I didn&#039;t see any results so I tried an ACV treatment for two hrs one day. It hurt like hell but I did notice a difference after that.

The only side effect I remember experiencing was dry mouth which was annoying, but very tolerable and temporary. Celexa very effectively eliminated my short temper/ snappiness, crying fits and it greatly enhanced my mood and outlook on life. On one occasion, while reflecting on a depressing exchange, I realized that I might be suicidal. I advised my doctor but continued to take it with no more problems but ultimately stopped because I didn&#039;t want to be dependent on medicines.

I have been much happier, more productive and sleeping better. I take it at night. The worst side effect I had was swelling around my ankles. But that went away. I&#039;m losing weight.

I have been taking it for years .... then my son told me the new reports about this causing dementia.  I stopped immediately.  The side effects after I stopped have been pretty severe.  I never dreamt that there would be withdrawals from this until I googled it but I have most of the symptoms (except for the shakes and nightmares).... dizzy, light headedness, nausea, unable to sleep.  After all I thought, since I talked to my doctor over and over about them (and he said no problem) and they were over the counter, I was good.  WRONG!  Bad stuff.  Tell everyone you know to stop them.",UNK
750,My starting weight was 297. Now two weeks later I&#039;m 283. After each increase I did have nausea and vomiting for a day or two. I thought I would have to stop and then I discovered Pepto-Bismol.  My second day of Pepto-Bismol I felt like a new man. According to the label you can have 2 tablespoons up to eight times a day which means every couple hours. This really made a difference in the side affects. I rated it a 9 only because of the side effects other than that I&#039;m 100% satisfied with this new medication!,UNK

However 20 minutes after insertion the cramps kicked in, I haven&#039;t had kids yet. But I swear the pain level of the cramps are what I assume is how contractions feel. It was so so bad. I love my OB so I drive a 30 minutes to see her. Needless to say the drive home was horrible. Once I finally got home the contraction cramps were so bad I was laying on the floor crying. The cramping did get better the next day and was completely gone in about 3 days. Originally I was on the pill and my body didn&#039;t like it and I was having a period 6 -7 days twice a month. Now I just spot brown discharge that has lightened up a lot",UNK

The only reason I&#039;m not rating it a 10 is because of the itching. When applied,  drysol causes me pretty severe itching in my underarms.

Those medicines make me feel like all my muscles need to be repeatedly stretched and like they are itchy on the inside.  Luckily I did not get this feeling at all today with just the intravenous Reglan.
Even managed to sleep through half the drip.  Only bad thing was that it was really cold going into my arm...my whole arm felt numb.

The pain made my moods and emotions full of anger, sobbing, outbursts, I felt non-human. Just no control of myself. I tried Dilaudid, and Tylenol 3&#039;s nothing worked and while in emergency I was treated with several drugs, the pain remained. Finally Dilaudid with a shot of Toradol and it took the pain, what a relief. I felt human again, I felt focused and I could see life and what was real. ",UNK

Swollen boobs, extreme mood swings and manic crying. Only then, after reading more closely into side-effects of the implant, did I realise that the 30 lbs I&#039;ve gained in that time may be linked.

Maybe due to other medication prior, my learning is better though focusing is not better due to my ADHD, and my back pain has been reduced. I have made more friends and feel much more normal more so then not, and I don&#039;t feel like I &quot;lost myself like another drug did to me in the past.

Insomnia for every single night, and night sweats. Couldn&#039;t sleep for more than 3 hours a night. Helped, but not the right med for me due to this. Try it!",UNK

This was my first real attempt to quit and decided on Vivitrol because it&#039;s non habit forming. I&#039;ve been on the shot for 5 months now. The reason I give it a so so rating is because it does nothing for your urges and cravings. That&#039;s a battle you still have to fight on your own. After my first injection I experienced &quot;brain fog&quot;, rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure for the next 24 hours. I was 14 days clean prior to the injection. The next 4 injections went smooth. Vivitrol also seems to effect my sleep pattern, bowel movements, and sex drive for two after each of the injections",UNK

They tend to carry things that other pharmacies do not. They also are able to more order things much easier because as a hospital, they must have these things available for people with allergies, etc. I wish the FDA/DEA would realize how harmful NSAIDs (especially ibuprofen) can be, and that everyone is different. What works for one may have horrible side effects for another. When taken responsibly narcotic analgesics are less harmful to the body, and this is a subject that i have researched extensively.

When the medication was injected into my IV it wasn&#039;t painful but it did go up my shoulder and I could actually taste it but after that all I remember was looking at the clock and them strapping me down on the surgery table and then I was in recovery. It&#039;s that simple. It&#039;s just like a regular nap. I woke up tired but no nausea, I wasn&#039;t groggy, no headache. I felt great. Would definitely do this medicine again.

Side effects were: Slight change of taste (sodas tasted flat, bread tasted sweeter), and gradual loss of memory and concentration, such that it was hard to read or study an issue at work and be able to understand it. It did not affect my eating habits or energy levels, did not affect my weight at all. It also did nothing for my migraines.

I finally got up the nerve to take it after doing all the research.   This is the first I have taken and I must say the aftertaste after about 5 minutes of taking it is absolutely HORRIBLE.  Even breathing in through my mouth or nose heightens it.  It strongly reminds me of how my mouth would taste after taking chemotherapy for cancer.   It&#039;s causing a horrible flashback for me.

I&#039;m a skin picker (bad) so that has aggravated my acne from touching my face and caused some minimal scarring which I can easily cover up with makeup. One of my least favorite things about this medicine is that, although it clears most of my clogged pores, I have noticed an increase in painful cystic acne around hotspots (potentially due to the onset of hormonal acne).",UNK

My acne cleared up, though I do break out when I get my period.  I don&#039;t have to worry if I&#039;ve forgotten to take my pill or if I&#039;m taking it at the same time everyday.

Went to doctor it was flu and pneumonia. She prescribed Tamiflu explained may be side effects. Well I was desperate. I took it and I didn&#039;t feel the best that night just slept but the next day I almost felt totally better! Thank the Lord with prayers and this medicine I am doing much better.

Watched as father died a slow natural death after years of health problems. Started Viibryd and on day four felt better. When titrating to 40mg felt bad physically in general, so have stayed on 20mg; been there for several weeks. I feel like the old me, not irritable and snappy, especially with my husband.  Feel more positive, confident and outgoing. I will be 57 in a few days. The bad: increased appetite especially for sweets and at night and 10  lb weight gain.

813,"My personal experience with suboxone is good so far. I have been on prescribed Fentanyl Patch 25 much/ 48 hrs. I have dropped to this dose over the last year. (I also left the old patch on). I have been on opiates for 12 years full time prescribed. At my highest prescription I was using 180mg of Oxycodone and 180 mg of morphine per day. I have had several adjustments on medicine including extended release doses. 5 years ago I was put on 50 mug of Fanta to with 3-10 mg Oxys per day for breakthrough. I started leaving my old patches on to increase my daily dose. This last year I tapered Down to 25 mcg patches for 48 hours.( still leaving my old patches on.) I went to a doctor that prescribes Suboxone. Lucky for me my insurance pays for Suboxone. He gave me the 8/2 mg strips. I take 1/2 a strip twice a day. I was checking every forum to see how long I needed to wait to start the suboxone. The replies are all very different. Some say 16 hours, most day 24. Others say 48-36-72 hours. Yikes! How do I keep out of precipitated withdrawals! I already have withdrawals every other day on my patch!... so I removed my patch last night around 5 pm. (I already have my suboxone script at home. ) so I started feeling withdrawal symptoms coming on around 11 pm. They didn&#039;t get super intense. I checked the cows scale as many articles suggested but only scored mild.. had the stretching of limbs symptom, anxiety.. so I took a half of a strip which was the suggested dose. I took it at 12 noon today. That&#039;s only 19-20 hours. I was in withdrawals, but not the worst I have ever had. I was scared of the precipitated withdrawals I heard about. 10-15 minutes after I took it, I felt a hot sensation wash over me. Thought I would get those withdrawals, but I took a quick bath, laid down for an hour and. Is I feel pretty good. Took my withdrawals away. I still have some muscle pain, but not the kind that come from withdrawals. Suboxone stopped the withdrawals right away. No headaches or sick feeling. Not high, but even my regular dose meds haven&#039;t made me high for years... so if your guessing on when it&#039;s ok to take suboxone after opiates, and fentanyl seems to be the highest strength, then I day shoot for 24 hours. If you are not in withdrawals at 24, then wait until you are.. if you are in withdrawals before 24 hours then just wait as long as you can. You will know when it&#039;s too bad to wait anymore. You know your body... you can always take half the amount prescribed and see how it reacts if your are afraid of precipitated withdrawals. Trust me, it will stop the withdrawals within a half hour. I have not gotten the precipices withdrawals so far. Hope this helps someone. Good luck to you!",UNK

Not only did I have horrific physical side effects such as vomiting after only the second dose of 5mg, but this stuff seemed to screw me up mentally - though that part could have also been due to Lexapro withdrawal.

From then on I determined not to let it get me down, and to exercise, not drink alcohol, and do all I could to remain healthy. When Harvoni became available it was like a huge blessing, I was so grateful for the chance to get rid of HepC. I realised what a priceless  gift I was being given, went to bed by 9 pm every night, exercised and did all I could to help it work. I did not experience side effects, except of a positive nature. Thank you Harvoni, I am cured. Yay!!!",UNK

(My periods are usually heavy and painful; I had vaginal delivery without anesthesia. The pain from the Skyla could be compared to my worst period cramping.) By the end of the first week they became tolerable, but I was still spotting. There were 2 or 3 days when I didn&#039;t spot, then I started having bad cramps again + spotting, and a long and painful period followed that was a little lighter than usual.
Well, I&#039;m still spotting/bleeding and having cramps and obviously not pregnant because I have no mood when I&#039;m in constant pain.
I&#039;m willing to give this method another 2 months...",UNK

I suffer from chronic severe migraines possibly hormone related and although in the beginning they got a lot worse, after one year on the pill my migraines have reduced to almost non-existent. I also suffer from PCOS and saw dramatic improvement with my periods. They became lighter and always on their time, whereas before the pill I used to bleed 2-3 times per month. However, this pill is not a panacea and it is definitely not harmless. My libido has reduced, I  too experience the occasional paranoia and extreme irritability, my cholesterol and triglycerides have risen although I follow a balanced diet and exercise but I did not gain any weight. All in all this pill works but needs a lot of patience.",UNK

867,I have been on the shot for 1 year. I have not had any trouble with acne or weight gain. My sex drive is just as high as usual. I have been depressed but depression has been a life long battle for me. The only real con I can think of is that for the first 3-5 days after I get the shot I am a crazy person. The mood swings are 100 times worse then PMS after those first few days. The rest of my three months are normal. Just hoping for the best with my bones.,UNK

I was already feeling full from Mt Dew and a cup of chicken broth. It was very difficult to chug it down. I am not a fan of Gatorade and this was like Gatorade on steroids. I got through it. Drank my first big gulp of Suprep at 2:15 p.m. tried to drink some more water but felt like I would vomit so I started sipping the extra water they tell you to drink. Half way through the first 16 oz and about 45 minutes into my anticipation, I had a mild twinge, was outside and had to cut my husband short.

I had little to no acne before taking it, and I have noticed I only get a few pimples here and there, my sex drive has not changed at all still pretty good. Mood swings are a bit of a problem to where I will get upset with my boyfriend for not replying in a timely matter, over dumb stuff I get upset. And no weight gain at all.

876,I did not like this product at all. The main reason I have difficulty getting any drops to even come out of the tubes. No matter how hard I squeezed no drops even though it showed liquid in the bottom. Yes of course I twisted the top off. At least one whole package was this way. Others was barely enough to get a drop in one eye let alone both eyes. Very frustrating and too expensive for me to ever order any more. I went back to my old drops which I never had any problems with. I am very dissatisfied with this product. I would like my money back although I doubt that will happen.,UNK

I had some bad cramping and then the bathroom trips started, as others have put it, it is like urinating out of your butt.

The horror began immediately on day one, the skin on my left arm shoulder area began to burn so badly, and my arm started to get numb, even my pinky finger I couldn&#039;t move.

After trying numerous medications for over 17 years to help with depression, I was really hoping for more. I would say that as an add on to Prozac, it is only somewhat effective. At first I was pleased by the lack of noticeable side effects compared to other antipsychotics. It didn&#039;t make me groggy during the day, nor did I experience any muscle twitches. However, at about the third month on 20 mg, I began getting severe akathesia shortly after ingesting. It manifested with inner restlessness (not normal for me), anxiety, and inability to stop moving. For me, this has gotten so unpleasant that I&#039;ve decided to stop it.",UNK

I woke up every hour. During the day I would have waves of nervous energy, almost like the feeling you get when you experience the fight or flight response. The last day I took it I woke up at 4 am with diarrhea, left sided abdominal pain that radiated to my back and shoulder, and heart palpitations. A trip to the ER revealed that I had a large amount of stool and gas in my colon. I had a miserable experience with Wellbutrin",UNK

Lets just start off saying that I made the switch from the NuvaRing to LoLo because the doctor recommended it because of the lower dose of hormones. The NuvaRing was great for my skin and regulating and shortening my periods but oh my god did it ever mess me up mentally. I was tired all the time, so moody and depressed, made me feel suicidal and unhappy all the time so thats why I switched. LoLo made my clear skin break out in cystic acne, made me have little sex drive, made me lose a tremendous amount of hair, and totally messed up my periods and made me spot throughout the whole month. I do not recommend LoLo",UNK

I am one of those people.  Diagnosed with severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder, my doctor started me on 10mg/day and despite minor, minor nausea for the initial 2 weeks, I have not had side effects.  My anxiety and depression were vastly improved within that 2-4 week window and I began to feel like my old self.  I have experienced no discernible effects on my sex drive,  which is a big negative side effect for many reviewers.

Other things I&#039;ve heard is if you go off Lamictal cold turkey, you&#039;ll get seizures.

I chose to start taking Visitril since the lexapro wasn&#039;t effective in ways I wanted and now on 50mg to 100 mg a day, I can say that it is easier to be focused on things that I really care about and I can usually notice the subtle change in my body when it stops working (in my stomach primarily) and I&#039;ll pop another one and will stay pretty level as long as it is in my system.",UNK

So I used the same cream and again I didn&#039;t notice any results until 3 weeks which gave dramatic improvement. It hasn&#039;t dried out my skin. My advice is stick at this medicine for at least 6 months because it&#039;s worth it.

The side effects now are not as bad as when she first started this medicine. Since she has been on it however she has not had as good of an appetite and some days she wont eat at all.

I didn&#039;t have any symptoms for this infection, so I can&#039;t say I notice a difference. I plan on getting tested again after I am done just to make sure. My only side effects are just a little nausea after taking them.",UNK
917,"I switched from Yaz (I was on it for 2 years) to Tri-Sprintec this month because of all the warnings. I think I would have rather suffered the blood clots and heart attacks than gone on this if I knew what was going to happen! About a week in I started getting really REALLY bad acne (just in time for spring semester!) like worse than I&#039;ve ever had. And not just on my face, on my back and chest too, which hasn&#039;t happened since middle school. I&#039;ve gained a lot of weight in the worst places even though I&#039;ve been going to the gym more and eating better and I SWEAR my breast size has actually gone down. I feel so unattractive I don&#039;t even want my boyfriend to touch me. ",UNK
918,"I initially got this shot because I was told that it would completely stop your period. Well it&#039;s been 3 months now and I haven&#039;t stopped bleeding!! The first 2 weeks were great, then I got my period and haven&#039;t stopped bleeding. It&#039;s not a heavy period or anything just consistently light blood/ brown stuff. It has been the most annoying thing ever!! Not only has that been bad, but this shot made me super depressed, emotional and moody! I&#039;m honestly surprised my boyfriend is still with me! Lol.  This has been such a horrible experience and I will definelty not be going back for another shot, I can&#039;t wait to have my normal period back for just a week each month. I will take a week of crampin over this shot anyday! I Really wanted to like it.",UNK
919,"I was so scared to take this prep after reading all of the horror stories...but it was so much easier than I anticipated! Unlike the average, I decided to space out both of my doses and drink them in 2 oz shot glasses every 10 minutes. My first dose was at 6 pm, and I wasn&#039;t sure how my body would react so I wanted to play it safe. I had my first movement within 30 minutes, and after that every 10 minutes or so.  Definitely make sure to be close to a restroom as the need to go is VERY strong! I drank ginger ale with my &quot;shots&quot; and sucked on lemon slices to get rid of the taste. To anyone reading this who is worried...DON&#039;T BE! It&#039;s really easy. Good luck!",UNK
920,"I switched from Suboxone to Subsolv and have had no problems. My insurance was canceled on me, and I had to look for a cheaper alternative, and Zubsolv has been it so far for me. Zubsolv has a WAY better taste over Suboxone, for me it was a mind over matter thing. I got used to the Suboxone, and the taste of it made me know I wasn&#039;t going to feel bad anymore, so I didn&#039;t mind it. Zubsolv is the same exact thing, but different taste, so don&#039;t let that freak you out.  Its a very minty clean feeling after you take it. I&#039;ve almost forgot to brush my teeth in the mornings because I had a good taste in my mouth from Zubsolv.  Keep your mouth closed for a long time, after you put it under your tongue, don&#039;t even talk, or you will screw up your dose",UNK

I now have an exposed bone in my gum by the molars. I was healing nicely then out of the blue I started having severe pain in my jaw.  It only lasted less than 10 minutes x 10 per day, but it would come on suddenly and was severe. My oncologist said it was probably nerve regeneration causing the nerves to spasm. He prescribed amitriptyline 10mg and said to increase every 3-4 days until I start feeling relief. I am on 30 mg now and no pain at all and yes I have been sleeping great. My mouth was already dry from the radiation so no problem.",UNK

He swore black and blue that this would fix my pains! Since the day the lady inserted it, I have bled so heavy, my pad needs to be changed every 40-90 mins. I have never had such bad pains in my life. I have consulted my doctor, the emergency wards, ANYONE. No one seems to know how to fix the problem, nor will anyone remove this stupid thing.

Basically, it gave me no side effects and no baby! It was really great. Unfortunately, it was being offered at my college for 25 dollars, but it&#039;s significantly more expensive out of pocket without the college discount, so I had to switch once my college stopped discounting it.

I have read that people have a lot more energy and don&#039;t think about eating. Well yesterday I took the 1st pill at 5.55am and I was hungry by 10.30am and sleepy again by 12noon. I tried taking a nap around 7 but couldn&#039;t get to sleep. Went to bed around 11.30pm slept fine. I am hoping to lose 65lbs but I will settle for 55lbs.

I will write back in 2 weeks if I lose any weight.,UNK

I have never been a heavy sweater but when I would wear them the combination of my sweat and the products would be a weird soapy smell.  I used Drysol at first once a week (using it 2 nights in a row gave me an armpit rash which hurt) but I used it when I needed *if I smelled and was sweating I would use it again that night*  I find the next night after using it my armpits are a little itchy, but I have nothing to say but good things about Drysol.  6 years later I don&#039;t even remember the last time I used it (maybe months ago) I have saved money on ruined shirts from pit stains and I don&#039;t ever smell.

I wasnt hungry at all, most days I wouldn&#039;t feel like eating untill lunchtime, then I would take a pill with a bottle of water before lunch then eat a small lunch, and an even smaller dinner.  I would try to walk for 20-30 minutes a day, sometimes more, sometimes I wouldn&#039;t get a chance to walk at all. The doctor was very pleased, as was I. He perscribed me for another 30 day perscription... But... I have done everything the same this round and haven&#039;t lost any weight at all. I have even threw in some extra walking. Has anyone else experienced this?",UNK

I tried every over the counter pain medication and Tramadol which did nothing. The pain in my back, left buttocks, left calf was debilitating. I could not put a pair of socks on let alone do any normal activity. My doctor then prescribed percocet and I have to say this drug is a God send. It actually has given me my LIFE back! I never get a &#039;high&#039;- there is no feeling of euphoria- what I do get is RELIEF of my pain so that I can actually work, play and live.

After seeing so many reviews saying how much better it&#039;ll get I&#039;ve decided I&#039;ll try my hardest to stick to taking citalopram, I just hope it&#039;ll be as life changing as many people have said on here!

Large dosage of Synthroid ineffective, nurse practitioner certain nothing wrong, physician A dosage is ok but maybe a small bump, small effect for short period then return to prebump effect, concerned that observation due to psychological rather than physiological waited, physician B does further workup, physician B sees most of Syntroid dosage going to reverse T3 (physiologically ineffective) adds Cytomel, the improvement was immediate; not psych.",UNK

Since getting the implant, I had one period that lasted about 3 weeks.  It wasn&#039;t bad.  Since then, no periods!  It&#039;s like a dream.  No other ill side effects - my sex drive is fine, no mood swings, and NO BABIES.  I would highly recommend trying this.  If you experience bleeding for 5+ weeks, CALL YOUR DOCTOR and they will probably remove it and recommend something else.  It won&#039;t work for everyone but it might work for you like it did me.  Just call your doc if anything feels wrong!",UNK
942,Awesome for controlling anxiety in the mind and letting you think clearly but I still feel the anxiety in my nerves but better alternative than benzodiazepines.

I took it on myself to reduce my dosage of TOPROL XL cutting it in half because my pressure was checking much lower and I did so for about two week prior to a Doctors appointment keeping a record of checks three to four times a day and gave it to my Dr. and he ran a EKG, then reduced my dosage in half and I&#039;m checking out fine at around 120/70/67 so suggest check your salt intake.",UNK

But after my experience I now can see they true. It was the first morning of my 3 week vacation in LA and I woke up with a cold sore. Awesome. It already was at its blister stage and so swollen and painful (top left side of lip). I got the abreva pump from cvs and spent a whole day continuously reapplying. It completely reduced the swelling and blister and now its completely shrunk and about to disappear and its day 2. Usually I get cold sores once or twice a year that last 10-14 days. I cannot believe this actually worked.  definitely worth the $22,UNK

When I finally met the psychiatrist I have today, with his help and his innate understanding of what bipolar is, it only took 3 or 4 different prescriptions to finally arrive at Effexor giving me the best overall help.

975,I have been on this injection for three months and it has changed my life! I wake up happy not worrying about what day of the month it is and being totally pain free From this awful disease! It has stopped the inflammation of the endometriosis which is growing all over my womb and ligaments and I&#039;m not bleeding every 21 days! My skin in perfect my nails strong and weight has stayed the same despite an increase in appetite ! No heaving floods or crippling cramps and bowel pain!

At first I thought it might be due to something else.  Perhaps Eczema or psoriasis, so I was buying all kinds of creams and nothing worked.  So I double checked my only prescription which is the femring and low and behold one of the possible side effects is a skin rash.  It&#039;s too soon to know for sure.  I hope it goes away.",UNK

The worst part of this whole experience, which was my first, was the anxiety of not knowing what to expect, not being able to eat any solid foods all day, and finally, the actual taste of the product.   I sucked on lime slices after each sip to kill the nasty taste.  I was able to down the mixture in a couple of minutes and it only took 15-20 minutes for the flood gates to open.  My suggestion is to stay on the throne while the medication is working.  The flushing comes without warning and goes in waves every 2-5 minutes or so.  The process was finished in about an hour.  I sipped on the additional 32oz of bubbly water for the next hour.   All in all not nearly as bad as I expected!",UNK

I didn&#039;t look up any reviews and just started taking it. I noticed I was packing on the pounds like every day so I stopped everything that I had recently changed in my routine. Now that I looked up all the reviews many people have had the same issue even though it is not listed as a side effect. I stopped the medicine a month ago and only took it for 30 days.

They both came back negative she said.. After my misscarriage I blamed it on stress and that things happen for a reason.. But lookin back and seeing other peoples reviews it makes me strongly believe that implanon was the main cause for my miscarriage..

I had it inserted on my period because that is when the cervix is most open, and it was definitely a little more than uncomfortable. It felt like more than a strong cramp... I would say it was close to a contraction (although I&#039;ve never given birth). I have a very high pain tolerance and I jumped out the chair a little bit, but it lasted for only 30 seconds.

I usually do fine taking pill forms of codeine, such as vicodin etc, but find that in taking this during the day, it causes such dizziness that you feel like you&#039;re on a horrible theme park ride.

Now I am struggling to find something else to help with the pain.",UNK

The only problem with this is I have A LOT, pretty much constant vaginal discharge (due to the progesterone). It&#039;s clear and watery.

I was told that it would take three months for my periods to taper off but it is just as bad now as it was 5 months ago.

All I could do was go in a dark, quiet room. Sometimes sound would set it off, but usually it would just happen all by itself. I had tooth fillings taken out, dental X-rays done, trying to find the cause. It&#039;s a rare disease. The doctor gave me 600mg Horizant ER samples and I took (1) a day after dinner at 4. It worked!

I tried using supplements as recommended by  Julia Ross in her book The Mood Cure, but they were not effective for me.  My depression became so severe last Oct. that I had to go back on to an anti-depressant (Bupropion) but this medication made my depression much worse.  I was then put onto Trintellix in April.  The Trintellix was helpful, but side effects soon began to appear.  

I happened upon an article about a psychiatrist who had used niacin for treating depression.   When I googled niacin and depression, I came upon many other blogs and comments from other people who also found niacin to be effective against their struggles with depression. 

 I was desperate to find an alternative to taking anti-depressants, so 4 weeks ago, I began supplementing with niacin plus vitamin C.   (I had already been taking a vitamin B multi, magnesium, fish oil and Vit. D).  I started with 100mcg niacin and have been gradually increasing the dose by 25mcg increments each day.  I use only the regular niacin, not the timed release nor the non-flushing type.

Since I started taking the additional niacin &amp; vitamin C,  I find that my depression is/has diminished significantly.  I am no longer suffering from that bottomless well of depressive  feelings that had been with me since last fall.

I tried this patch again and it did not seem to work. I will try it again soon on another cruise and hope it works. I too have tried many different remedies and nothing worked as good as the patch.

It is the fifth day, however, and while my sense of taste has come back about 40%, my sense of smell has not come back at all. I became curious and looked up &quot;Flonase and sense of smell&quot; on the internet. Apparently, people are reporting loss of sense of smell when using this product. I hope mine comes back.",UNK

I would take it and an hour later, not remember anything. Also, I would still wake up every hour. It helped me fall asleep, but not stay asleep.  Recently, I over dosed on Ambien.  That is what really woke me up.  This is not for me.  I have been prescribed Seroquel for my sleeping problems and this is wonderful. I have no more sleepwalking and I remember everything.",UNK

My biggest problem was that it caused erectile dysfunction and a strange lack of sensation in my prostate area, even at low dosage (18 mg/day). It was sufficient to stop use.  I am on Adderall XR now which doesn&#039;t do nearly as well.  My doctor is going to try me on some antidepressants as they also influence the norepinephrine levels.  If you don&#039;t get the erectile dysfunction then this is a great medication.",UNK

Side effects include increased hunger (actually I am pleased about this as I am rarely hungry and don&#039;t really enjoy food). I have read that it can cause depression, but for me it is the opposite. I am far less depressed and have more energy and feel less overwhelmed.  The effects only last for the 2 weeks that I am taking it each month.  My body seems to love this medicine.  It is too soon to ascertain whether my polyps have shrunk/disappeared.

Sometimes I don&#039;t increase the dosage during one of these episodes but take a hot bath which helps.  When I have been without the meds for a couple of days, not even a hot bath will help.

And those who use it for pain tend to use it like their other prescribed meds. The bad comes mostly from those who use it for substance abuse treatment. Methadone is NOT a treatment of substance abuse, but a tool to aid in the treatment of substance abuse. It does not cure withdrawal, it stops withdrawal symptoms when at a therapeutic level. You will experience withdrawal symptoms when methadone is tapered or discontinued. Those using methadone for substance abuse tend to treat methadone in similar ways as a street drug.

1117,Methadone has been the only pain medicine that I&#039;ve found that relieves my back and neck pain and allows me to work and function without being high or loopy. The only problem that I have found is finding a Doctor who is aware that methadone is used for more than treatment of heroin addiction.

I used to use trazodone for sleep/sedation as I have insomnia but honestly hydroxyzine is better. The best difference was the size of the pill. The trazodone was too LARGE trapezoid pills that felt like they got stuck in my throat tasted horrible even with 1-2 cups of water. The &quot;hangover&quot; of trazodone was also much more intolerable. The hydroxyzine takes about 10 minutes once you are up for the grogginess to go away versus 30 minutes with my previous alternative.

Reduced anticipation of negative events and occurrences. Obsessive compulsive rituals reduced. Answer the phone with more ease and less concerned about making mistakes in front of people.

I have experienced a few headaches and yes, the coughing, but compared to having a heart attack from being overweight, I am fine with that. If you are overweight, I think you should give this medication a try for at least a month or two. Also, never felt jittery at all on this. The biggest downside is the cost.

It just depends! This is my first BC and I&#039;m 21 so I haven&#039;t really had much other experience but this is all what I expected. It&#039;s okay but if it&#039;s not working for you talk to your Gyno and find one that does!",UNK
1146,"Hello everyone and warm thanks for all extremely helpful comments!
I received my second Stellar injection about one month ago, an phased out the cyclosporine one week ago. The skin is incredibly clear of spots (since 25 years it has not been this good), but as a change, an almost intolerable itching started. 

a) Would anyone have experience how to calm down the itching? 

Taking sodium bicarbonate with water seems to help a bit, but I am still scratching in my sleep.  I have allergies, and thought that maybe antihistamine could work.

Thanks in advance for any hints you may have!",UNK

I&#039;ve had mood swing, I&#039;ve been prescribed antidepressants, and most recently I had a period that lasted 5 months straight. I had to double up with pills for it to stop.

It started at bi-weekly, then she started getting it weekly.  While on Humira, my daughter has been hospitalized six times in 14 months and has had surgery to get a stuck camera pill out and then a perforated bowel.  I wouldn&#039;t say it has been working. I will say that the first time she had a dose, she felt hungry, which was wonderful.  But it was rather short lived.  We need to find something else.",UNK

Take it at night with a snack to fend off the nausea. STAY HYDRATED. You&#039;re going to confuse thirst with hunger on this pill. Drinking more water will combat bloating, weight gain, and fatigue. It takes longer to recover after workouts. My mood has improved drastically, as well as sex drive and wetness. My acne got worse, but I&#039;ll give it a few more months to straighten out. Love it so far.",UNK
1154,I started using Spiriva a month ago.

1157,I have polycystic ovarian syndrome and heavy menstrual bleeding. The doctor prescribed Lysteda 650MG tablets. My doctor stated he only wants me to take 1 tablet by mouth once daily. He prescribed me 6 pills with 2 refills. I took one yesterday. 12/11/2012 around 3:00. All I have been doing since is spotting. I am in WOW mode because I could not believe how fast it worked. The side effect I got from it is a headache. I am not experiencing any clotting. I also take vitamins. Since I have PCOS so my periods are irregular. They started being irregular when I was 20. I have always had regular periods until I turned 20. They diagnosed me on May 11th 2012 a day before my wedding anniversary and been battling since then.,UNK
1158,"I told myself that if a miracle happened and this worked, that I would write a review. Let me start off by saying that this drug, literally, saved my LIFE. I&#039;ve always battled anxiety and panic attacks, and was on a small dose of Paxil and that seemed to take the edge off. I took it on and off for years. After I had my second baby at 28, I got terrible postpartum depression. I had thoughts of suicide, racing thought constantly, couldn&#039;t nap and took forever to fall asleep at night. I literally spent three months just thinking and obsessing over how horrible I felt. I wanted to crawl out of my skin and die. I was barely showering, brushing my teeth and hair and would stay in the same sweatpants and shirt for days. I could go on forever by I&#039;ll get to the point. After three months of pure hell, I went to my doctor for help. I was prescribed 50 ML of Zoloft. After being on it for 4 weeks, I stopped taking it because it wasn&#039;t working. After going another 2 weeks feeling miserable, I went to my doctor again.  She recommended we up the dose and stay on it for atleast 6 weeks. Well, after two weeks on 100 ML, I realized I was feeling better. I would go minutes without thinking negatively, then I would go hours, then full days. It feels SO good to feel like myself again. I truly thought I would be miserable forever. Please get help and try something if you are feeling terrible. Everyone is curable with the right drug and right dose. I wish I got help sooner. TRY THIS! It will work! If for some reason it doesn&#039;t, try something else! GET HELP NOW! I was doing the same thing you are - googling all types of antidepressants convinced there was no cure and they would never work. Stop spending your life wondering when you will be yourself again. You WILL get better and be 100% your old self again with an antidepressant!",UNK

Unfortunately, less than a week into the sample pack, I started getting unusual sharp pains in my left leg and foot. Then, twice in the same day, I felt a shocking pain on the right side of my head/face/neck, so bad I instinctively curled up and held my head. I stopped taking the pill and felt no more pains.

I used to get cystic acne terribly on my face and every birth control has had a different side effect for me. This one has been pretty bad. I no longer have terrible cystic acne on my face, but now it has appeared all over my back. Also, if you are taking depression medication, I really don&#039;t recommend. This has absolutely made me more depressed and I&#039;ve also gained a lot of weight after almost 3 months of it. I think the pill makes me need to emotional eat.",UNK
1167,Yeah  I really had no side effects during the pills except for fatigue and the occasional shooting pain in the liver area.

My husband lost his mother to a burst bowel so he is especially concerned. Never was a &ldquo;poop a day girl&rdquo; either. Having found Movantik is why I&rsquo;m breathing a sigh of relief. If I can ever get off the opioids, it will be a happy day. But until then, I thank the Movantic developers. True I, on occasion, will take a nausea pill but I did that before Movantik.

I now have a foggy thought process and have a hard time making decisions as well as anxiety and slight depression- which I&#039;ve never EVER had before. The only thing that kept me on this is that it stopped my periods which was convenient... But not worth it.  Please don&#039;t do this to yourself, I have stretch marks from the weight gain...

I tried Ambien CR and it took longer to fall asleep on that and I still only got around 4-5 hours of sleep on the CR version.

Now I take it 1 week on, 1 week off.  I notice lots of energy and dry mouth and a happy feeling for the first 4 days and then I start feeling sad, which then goes away in about 4 more days.

On my second month, I became depressed and began to have anxiety attacks for just about everything. When my boyfriend and I would have relations he would tell me I was shedding more hair than normal. I paid more attention to it and my scalp began to hurt as if I had my hair in a ponytail and just took it out.

I wear contacts, I prefer them so much more than my glasses but sometimes my contacts will start getting super blurry and I can&#039;t see at all. Sometimes I&#039;ll put in my contacts and leave the house, and while I&#039;m driving my contacts start blurring up so I&#039;ll have to pull over and take them out and put on my glasses.

I will say the consistent side effect is Nausea Vomiting and no appetite. I don&#039;t mind it as I&#039;m finally pain free and I just eat small meals!",UNK

1205,"This was my first birth control and I found a few pros and cons with it. I used it for 3 months. Pros: shorter and lighter period, and little to no cramps. Cons: vaginal dryness, vaginal sensitivity, very low sex drive, very bad acne. I switched to another pill since it wasn&#039;t for me. However, just because it didn&#039;t work for me doesn&#039;t mean it won&#039;t work for other people.",UNK
1206,"Although it has only been a week of using Aviane, I have to say that I love it. I&#039;ve been on the patch and it definitely made me moody, to the point where I would cry constantly and randomly. It made me gain 10 lbs in a week and I just hated it so much. Aviane so far, is amazing. I&#039;ve been at my lowest weight (during my period), I&#039;ve lost my appetite though, but it&#039;s not necessarily a bad thing. No bloating, no break outs, but I am experiencing longer period flow. But it&#039;s only been the first week. So fingers cross that this will keep being amazing to me.",UNK

I occasionally will get powerful sulfur burps followed by vomiting. The medicine does keep my sugar under control, my last A1C was 6.0. ",UNK
1208,This medication works very well and I&#039;ve had no side effects that I wasn&#039;t already having by taking Norco.  It&#039;s very effective and keeps my pain from getting too high so I don&#039;t require a lot of other pills to bring my pain level down.  The only thing I don&#039;t like is that my insurance declined my coverage stating they didn&#039;t feel it was needed.  How my INSURANCE can determine that is crazy.  My doctor prescribed it for a reason.  Love this medication.  I&#039;m able to function and work and am never sleepy at work.,UNK

Depression is painful emotionally, mentally and physically, without the some kind of relief I would have been institutionalized.  For maximum effectiveness, counseling by a person trained in all aspects of the disorder is the only one I found to help bring me back to a realistic understanding of how to heal.

The Cons: 

- have not slept more than 3 hours for 14 days. 
- I am severely on edge from day 9-14. Had a panic attack going to work and yesterday was foaming at the mouth in a road rage incident where I became almost homicidal.

Neuro said was not meds and kept giving me something for anxiety. Nothing helped so I figured it was me and would have to live with it. Decided to go off and see if that helped. Has been a week and a half and I feel the symptoms fading away already.  Don&#039;t know if I will go back to 20mg or just stay off of it.

It wasn&#039;t that it was cramps, I felt more of intense pressure then anything else. 9.5/10 pain.  I&#039;m now a week in to having it and let me tell you, I am an emotional wreck. One minute I am happy, next I&#039;m definitely not!  I have no idea how long this is going to last, but I sure as hope not for long. It&#039;s ridiculous. Now, as for the bleeding. I have not had any of the spotting, or anything of the sort. So that&#039;s a plus. Occasionally I will feel slight cramps but only really minor. As for the sex part, my partner has felt the wire or thread a few time during intercourse. So thats not fun..",UNK

Even my family and work friends mentioned how much better my face was looking. Now being in the forth week, I only have a few acne spots and my face is less red.

I actually lost weight during the time I took it, but every evening I&#039;d need to eat enough sugar for 10 people to curb the craving.  Secondly, it was TERRIBLE for sex drive.  Absolutely horrid.

My one and only con is that you have take it around the same time every day or it will mess with your cycle a bit (causing ovary discharge and such) but if you  miss a pill and follow your chart it should work out with no problems. It has reduced my cycle to about 2 days and reduced cramps. Highly recommend!,UNK

It helped me to do my own research so I can suggest my choice of treatment to my psychiatrist, rather than just trusting the one he suggests. After being diagnosed bipolar 2, he suggested another med. I strongly advocated for Lamictal. I tapered up to 200mg, on a conservative schedule. I&#039;ve had good results over the past 9 months. It definitely has lowered the instances of hypomania, or at least deescalated the intensity. It&#039;s done little to address the depression or anxiety, so we&#039;ve agreed to add anti-depressant. Again, he suggested Cymbalta, which I opposed due to the all the information regarding withdrawal syndrome. We agreed on a low dose of Prozac which is going well so far.",UNK

I have been taking 15mg of Deplin for almost 3 weeks now and have been experiencing some of the lowest depression that I have ever felt.  Today I woke up feeling just as miserable as I have been for the past 3 weeks so I decided not to take Deplin.

The pain was so bad it kept me up all night. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with a &quot;very bad&quot; UTI. After 2 days of 2x 500 mg ciprofloxacin, I started to feel better, and after 3 days, I felt nearly fully recovered.

I got on phentermine 2 months before I started on Lyrica to drop weight cause I did know of the potential side effects and it has been a blessing.  I continue with half a pill of phentermine a day along with 75mg 2x a day and even dropped 5 more lbs when I started the Lyrica in February.  No swelling or hunger - maybe because of the phentermine but it&#039;s worked for me.  I also was temporarily put on Cymbalta and it did not work for me.

Two days into my second pack I started my period but it was very light compared to what&#039;s I&#039;ve  had in the past. Here it is 10 days later and I&#039;m still bleeding.. I&#039;m gonna stop this pill and go get the IUD in next week. I wouldn&#039;t recommend this pill.,UNK

I was always sleepy &amp; lazy with a why bother attitude for everything. My mind would still wander but it would be blank. I started forgetting things I&#039;ve always known like my zip code. It started affecting me at work. I called my doctor who said my symptoms weren&#039;t from the wellbutrin but the other meds I&#039;m on. I stopped taking the wellbutrin yesterday, I already have more energy, I&#039;m noticeably less shaky (my boss noticed), I&#039;m more focused. I feel better than I have in a long time.

My MD really wanted me on an antidepressant- I wanted away from benzodiazepines, so I took a chance with Paxil. The first month was bit of nausea/cramps - worst were feelings and thoughts were really jumbled.

Also, my periods are usually only about 3 days long when they used to be almost a week. I love this birth control! Also, I haven&#039;t gotten pregnant yet which is a huge plus. Only negative is I have gained about 15 pounds since starting Kariva (much of which went straight to my breasts). This weight gain could however be from the stress of college and a new boyfriend. Also, the first month I took the pill I would get incredibly nauseous everyday around 8 or 9 pm, but thankfully that subsided. Occasionally I will get this way on the first pill of a new pack but it is bearable. Overall, love it.",UNK

This time (different doctor and city), they&#039;ve prescribed a regimen of miralax, magnesium citrate, and suprep.  The miralax and magnesium citrate were fine.  The suprep, however, was the most vile thing I&#039;ve ever had in my mouth.  

It&#039;s not the cherry flavor, it&#039;s the sodium in the solution that causes the instant nausea when it touches your tongue.  I managed not to vomit the first prep, but couldn&#039;t handle the second.  And this prescription, not covered by insurance, cost over $100.",UNK

I stopped the Chantix and called my family doctor.  She did a neuro exam on me and everything was okay.  I had an MRI which was negative.

But during this time I realized my digestion was completely off and I developed acid reflux (which I&#039;d never dealt with before). Constant headaches and brain fog became the norm for me, as well as nauseousness and abdominal pain. I also became way more fatigued, and even developed dry mouth.

The depression  came back gradually during this time getting worse day by day. Nothing bad was happening in my life during this time. My doc. classifies this as clinical depression.

My periods were so heavy though and without realizing it I think I became severely anemic.  I had it removed and within 2 weeks started to feel alive and normal again.  That is when I realized I must have been anemic.   Years later I had Mirena put in due to my long spotting periods.  Couldn&#039;t tolerate the hormones.

I still can&#039;t do what I used to do but no medicines take away Fibromyalgia. I&#039;m happy to be on Nucynta because for me it doesn&#039;t cause drowsiness like the others do. Maybe a little light headed but doesn&#039;t last long. I would recommend it. 2 months ago I broke my toe and Nucynta was awesome dulled the pain! So for me Nucynta has been very positive to me.,UNK

I am 5&#039;6 about 154lbs. I only want to drop about 20lbs for my wedding and I was told this is not habit forming. I exercise and I am on a low cal diet. This medication does not curb my appetite but it does curb my intake which I LOVE. I don&#039;t want to stop eating all together and gain all the weight back as soon as I stop taking it.

If I have a headache next time I know what not to do when I go to the ER.  I thought I was the only one but thanks to the internet we can share our experience. I would think they where using us as lab rats that med has weird side effects I&#039;m still feeling it. I took it on 9/6/2015 and today I feel jittery &amp; can&#039;t relax.

I&#039;ve only been on it probably around 2-3 weeks and I saw an immediate difference.

My side effects: weight gain of 6+ lbs in one month, breast tenderness, constipation accompanied by gas and bloating, lethargy spanning from feeling &quot;run-down&quot; to complete exhaustion where I slept for 19 hours, extremely painful cramping with diarrhea.  When I started bleeding the cramps were worse than ever before (part of the reason I began taking Seasonique was to lessen the pain and cramping associated with my cycle).  The cramping has been debilitating for 4 days now and is only mildly relieved with Pamprin.

1324,I started Microgestin in June. I had read tons of horrible reviews and my experience was far from scary. I had never been on any birth control before. The first month I spotted off and on by the second month my bleeding was mostly done. I used Microgestin continuously because my periods give me unbearable cramps. The second month I got an yeast infection which I had never had before and started getting terrible night sweats to the point I would wake up freezing and would have to change my clothes in the middle of the night. I also started getting terrible headaches. I decided to stay on this pill until March. I continued to have terrible headaches and night sweats. However it did work for keeping flow away.,UNK

I felt relief from my despondency within a handful of days, and that has continued through this, my third month. I had my dose increased to 60mg to try and get relief from the chronic pain, but it has not been effective for me in addressing that - thus my rating. For depression, I give it a 10, but for pain (my experience) I have to give it at best, a 3. After consulting with my doctor, he said I could resume taking ibuprofen at a much lower dose.",UNK

1336,"Kava is as close to the effects of Valium as one can get from a legal substance. It definitely is a direct muscle relaxant and definitely does it through the GABA receptors. However, there&#039;s no lassitude - no real euphoria or feeling of elation either - but to me that&#039;s the actual beauty of kava. It&#039;s GABAergic effect is most noticeable when taken during a time of discomfort.

Kava has quickly reversed full-blown panic attacks and also markedly reduced pain, probably because of it&#039;s direct muscle relaxation. I also sleep like a baby after taking it. But if one is looking for an upfront euphoria (i.e., a recreational drug) then that person is likely to think that kava does nothing.",UNK

He was doing well in school, but by the time he got home the medication had worn off, and we were dealing with the same problems.

I was my doctors first patient to receive the treatment.  I am so grateful for this option.  Before Botox I could not go far from home.  Walking my dogs meant I had to wear a pad the size of a brick.  By the time I made it home it would be soaked.  At the age  of 45I was depressed with my condition &amp; options.

But it worked within an hour (at 0.5 mg) and the benefits were dramatic. I was still aware of the anxious thoughts in my head, but I could prevent myself from going down the futile path of rumination.
However, the major drawback is sedation. It&#039;s not the &quot;down&quot; sort of sedation I&#039;ve experienced on other medications. My mood and motivation stay good, but it feels like I need to take a nap mid-afternoon or sleep an extra hour or two. For me, this isn&#039;t acceptable long-term.

It did hurt quite a bit for me for about 1.5 weeks after though, but I think that was because at the job I had at the time, I was lifting boxes and things like that on a regular basis (I worked at a liquor store).

I have little to no side effects except nipple and breast tenderness and some cramping before periods. Get Skyla!",UNK
1439,I took this for 4 months. It gave me awful almost dangerous constipation . I felt dumb most of the time. I was never sad nor happy. I wouldn&#039;t recommend this unless nothing else worked.,UNK

I noticed an immediate increase in energy, and even felt a little jittery.  The doctor said it typically takes 2-3 weeks for it to fully kick in, but some people notice a change within 24-48 hours, which was me.  I have decreased appetite and a lot of foods upset my stomach, so I&#039;m eating less as well.  Subsequently, I&#039;ve lost some weight (which I like since I need to lose some!)  I feel like doing things again and actually have some sort of sex drive, which had been completely absent for a while with the depression.

I had a very bad infection across my chin and up to the right side of my nose, small red pumps, and and itchy rash that would peel over and got infected. Within 2 days I noticed a huge difference. This medicine saved my life for sure. Dermatitis and skin issues on the face can really do a number on your self esteem. I am back to almost clear skin and so so happy. A little tired and was dizzy at first but promethazine helps with that if your doctor can prescribe it, helps with nausea. other then that, this medicine rocks.",UNK

Wasn&#039;t too hungry, but knew I couldn&#039;t eat anyway. The Suprep was hard to get down, could have been a bit smoother, got to work on the sweetness. It worked within 10 minutes, I thought it would take a few hours. It&#039;s 8:30 PM now and I feel pretty cleansed. Still drinking Gatoraid.

I agonized over this choice for weeks, but after 6 months of unbearable anxiety and sadness, then skyrocketing blood pressure, I knew I had to do something. I visited my GP - we did the physical, blood tests, etc. to rule out other factors.  It turns out empty nest   beginning menopause have done a number on me.  The medicine made me feel nauseous, sleepy, like being on cold medicine.  On the 10th day, my appetite returned! I don&#039;t notice side effects at all anymore.  The sadness - 97% gone.  The anxiety - 75% gone.  I also start visits with a therapist in 2 weeks.  Again, I&#039;m grateful to get my life back.",UNK

The symptoms I received was Nausea, Fatigue, Excruciating Headaches.. And about a week or so after taking the pills, I received a horrible case of a yeast infection. Causing me to go running back to Planned Parenthood to get a prescription for Yet another pill. 3 weeks after taking Plan B, my cycle had finally came (4 days earlier than usual) and it was extremely light.

First pill took around 11am yesterday, by 2pm I was nauseous, dry heaving, had incredibly bad diarrhea, double vision, back pain, and was becoming very lethargic.

Tried 11 meds before without result, still locked into depression. Was tired or hyper while we worked out the dosage. Very slight hair loss was a small price to pay for a new life!

I&#039;ve been on this for about 2 years. The biggest thing for me, it cleared up my awful hormonal acne. I used to be on Lo Lo-Estrin and that ruined my skin. I still have some scars. It hasn&#039;t helped a ton with oil production on my face either. I still tend to be oily. As far as weight gain, this pill hadn&#039;t affected me that way.",UNK

1457,I took Clomid for the first time last month. My husband and I tried for a year. I have a blocked Fallopian tube. I had to use estrogen medicine also because my uterine lining was too thin. Then my doctor had me use HCG shot to stimulate ovulation since Clomid can apparently mess up if/when ovulation occurs. I took the HCG shot over 2 weeks ago. I noticed some weird symptoms a few days ago and I just took multiple pregnancy tests. And I&#039;m pregnant! So Clomid worked great for me so far. Yay!,UNK

I had no bleeding after insertion &amp; didn&#039;t have a period until 8 weeks later. I recommend having someone drive you home &amp; taking a heating pad with you. Take Motrin like an hour before you go. I would 100% do it again &amp; hope that the rest of my time with it works out.

My appetite however has disappeared, and the feeling for food often doesn&#039;t happen (I don&#039;t feel hunger pains). I suggest bringing snacks like nuts around to fill you up (A handful fills me up on this medication). I also have some trouble sleeping at night, but once I fall asleep I found I stay asleep.

I have tried a variety of different forms of birth control and none have given me more symptoms than this. My sex drive has always been above average and since being on this birth control, I have had zero desire to have sex and when I do, it takes quite a bit of foreplay to get me only barely wet. On top of that, my mood swings are INSANE. I have been more angry in these last two months than in my whole 25 years of life. While it is great for convenience, I would not recommend this certain type of birth control to anyone.",UNK

After about three months with it in I started to get depressed and have anxiety attacks 24/7. I&#039;m constantly hyperventilating. I couldn&#039;t figure out why it was happening until I did research on my birth control yesterday. I thought I was going crazy. My anxiety is so bad that it has caused 24/7 depersonalization. I don&#039;t feel like myself anymore and my acne is cystic and doesn&#039;t go away with any kind of face wash -even with prescribed face wash. I have my period 2 weeks to 3 weeks out of each month, which is irritating when you are in a serious relationship. So I made an appointment to have it removed, fingers crossed.",UNK

I actually started taking it Macrobid, 100MG twice daily for 7 days, BEFORE coming to this site to read the reviews. Firstly, it says to take it with food or milk, so many probably didn&#039;t follow those directions b/c it will give you nausea/vomiting if you don&#039;t. The only side effect I&#039;ve had is drowsiness. But my doctor also prescribed me with metronidazole 500mg, taken twice daily WITH the Macrobid to offset symptoms that can bring on a yeast infection etc.  I only get UTIs once or twice a year, but this one reared it&#039;s ugly head and Macrobid worked wonders for me.",UNK

I went to a neurologist, and he changed my script to Mirapex. The 1st night was wonderful, the next full day, I was sleepy.

Lithium, not sure what it does to me but tries to block my emotional feelings which is good and bad at the same time. I still feel sadness though. Everyday.",UNK

My period that had lasted for three months nonstop ended immediately when I started Yaz, so I was excited. But, I began cramping everyday, for the entire month. For the first three weeks I had bad attitude and was depressed. I started breaking out, and I became very tired all the time.

My first period was long- 2 to 3 extremely mind bogglingly heavy days, 3 normal days, and 5 extremely light days (spotting). No cramps though.

I started with a white cap, a 1.0  mg.  It worked great for me, but some people had problems with that dose of 1 mg and the FDA said doctors could not write anything above .50, or two white caps, .25.  When I had to reduce my dose, it took me 6 months to get my body adjusted.  So, 31 years later, I am 59 now and have to have the .50 to sleep.

I just found out that i&#039;m pregnant, as they were in the process of getting me started to try accutaine...i&#039;m glad i was pregnant because, i&#039;d rather use this stuff if it works first, rather than a harsh med.

Upon moving to a different state that had no such program, I got a prescription and opted for the generic equivalent--tri sprintec. At first everything was fine and I did not notice a difference. After the first month or so I began experiencing noticeable mood swings that would occur during any time of my cycle. I also noticed an increase in nausea and acne.

The final straw was living on Imodium.  While Imodium helped, I realized it was not going to be a long term solution, so I began searching for another answer and thankfully came across this website.

I was tested for everything including MRI and using novocaine and other pain killers. Nothing helped. After 5 months of constant pain, my doctor suggested discontinuing Crestor. The pain was completely gone within a week. Come to find out, my Sciatic nerve passed through my Piriformis muscle instead of around it like in most people. The Crestor had caused toxicity in the Piriformis muscle  which caused it to squeeze the Sciatic nerve continuously, causing continuous pain.",UNK

I was not happy with the choices he gave me and he was very adamant that I needed to change medications.  I did some research about another MS Clinic and made an appointment there. My Dr now is still very careful with me and keeps taking blood tests every 3 months to monitor my JC number. Last month my number was .65 and as long as it stays below 1.5 he is Ok with me taking it.

I hadn&#039;t used it for a couple of months before last night, and the burning/itching was almost too much to tolerate, but no sweating today. The negative about this product is that it now has a new sponge top that you apply yourself.

I was prescribed an up-dose (2mg three times daily, but I usually only took one pill a day or two, because 2mg is very strong). I was also prescribed Xanax to take along with Clonazepam due to having a panic disorder as well as generalized anxiety, but after about a year I decided that the Xanax was pretty useless (and tasted like wet chalk) so asked my psychiatrist to stop prescribing it. Just clonazepam. It&#039;s great.",UNK

It tastes like salty cherries, and I had no problems drinking it. It was almost pleasant. I chilled it prior to drinking and drank it like a beverage (mixed with water). 2) I experienced no nausea, no headaches, no cramping, none of the horrible side effects I read about. Just a faucet butt about 15 minutes after I drank the dose that lasted intermittently for an hour. Really not that bad.

After losing some weight, pressure dropped as well.  116/68. I started feeling extremely dizzy. Broke the pill in half and dizziness improved.

Every time I turned my head, I would feel very disoriented and lightheaded again.

My Doctor has me trying everything except oxycodone or oxycontin - The goal is to get completely away from those two (due to pressure from the Government).  My daily oxycodone is down to three 30mg plus three 30mg Opana ER (tamper proof).  Right off the bat my pain went up. The Opana 30 ER has zero effect regarding pain management.The main side effect is nodding off. &quot;Example* It has taken me 36 minutes to write this&quot;.

I decided it was time to call on the big guns.  This stuff is pretty great!  My psoriasis cleared up in about a month and my PsA was gone pretty much instantly!  The injections are a little uncomfortable but if you let it warm up a bit and learn the tricks it&#039;s not so bad.  Small sacrifice really.

That worked great but the problem was the cost and insurance not willing to cover it. So, we decided to try Nuvigil because it was half the cost of the Provigil (over $600 for 30 pills), Nuvigil I could get for about $311.00 for 30 250mg tablets but insurance still won&#039;t cover it for my conditions.

The side effect that causes them to take me off of it was because it was making me manic (as I am bipolar) and it caused me to make quick, risky, and ill-advised life decisions.

Taking me off the drug has effectively stopped the quick life decision side effect, and after getting off of it, I&#039;ve been able to think more clearly, be more mindful of my movement and thought-processes, and gave me a general feeling of wellness.

She is having violent uncontrollable shaking in her legs. She is experiencing numbness in her tongue and her speech is very slurred, probably because it seems as though her tongue is also swollen.

It threw my pH off SO bad. I was so sensitive that any little thing would make me have a yeast infection. So I switched to Lolo (samples) and wow! I was a little but moody at first but it went away. I just haven&#039;t had my period yet and that&#039;s never happened before so I&#039;m kind of freaking out. Took a test and came back negative.

I see the comments that people have received chemical burns or other painful issues with this product. It may be that their ph levels are off and it isn&#039;t a YI that they have in the first place. I&#039;d advise you to use a vaginal ph first and go from there.",UNK

Even though I know I might not have experienced the adverse side effects, I was not willing to risk it. I will definitely do more research next time! 
For the 24 hours I had it, I did feel quite nauseous and nearly fainted twice. Other than that, the insertion and removal was fairly painless.",UNK
1604,"I have a lot of metal in my spine and this helps a lot without making me drowsy or &quot;stoned&quot;. I can function almost normally on this medication, with the only things holding me back from normal function being the actual metal screws and the associated pains in the torn muscles and sciatic nerve. The pains are still there, but definitely a lot more manageable with the oxycodone. After a brief &quot;breaking in&quot; period my thinking processes returned to normal, with little to no losing track of thoughts or other side effects you might expect with a narcotic like this.",UNK
1605,"I knew going into it that the Mirena device was going to hurt, but being that I have a very high pain tolerance and have gotten used to lots of uterine pain (I&#039;ve had really heavy periods accompanied by intense cramping since I was nine), I really didn&#039;t think it would be all that bad. I was wrong! I&#039;m so glad I had my fiance drive me and pick me up to the actual insertion appointment; after I got it, the doctor asked me to sit up and I almost fainted. My blood pressure dropped and I thought I&#039;d be sick. It hurt a whole lot whenever I sat or bent over for the first week and a half to the point where I thought something was wrong and kept checking the strings to make sure it hadn&#039;t perforated. It works well and I love it now.. but the initial pain is BAD.",UNK
1606,"I have had the Implanon rod in my arm for two years. It made me have a period for 19 days and off for about 4 to 5. My hair was falling out, horrible cramps and bad headaches. I have switched over to the Lutera pill and instantly it has made a difference. I did have a little bit of tenderness in my breasts. Yes, I crave sweets. But who doesn&#039;t? My periods come the same day every month and are light and easy. I love this product. For the past six months it has been good to me.",UNK

Its 07/16/08 I weigh 218 lbs. That&#039;s a 90 lb loss from the date I started and 99 lbs since my heaviest. I do excerise for around an hour several times a week. I eat almost anything I want just in small portions. I cry when I look in a mirror.",UNK
1608,I had OCD for 3 years. I could not sit down. I was eating while I was unable to concentrate on anything else than my thoughts. I would avoid going to the bathroom because I could not seat down on the toilet. In order to avoid my thoughts I was walking about 11 km per day. I would fall asleep thinking about something and in the next morning I would wake up thinking the same thing. I had the same exact thought for 3 days until something else stuck in my mind. I am taking 250 mg a day now and everything is good. The only think is that Coffee and Alcohol messes up the medication. One day after two coffees I had to take something else to calm my self down.,UNK

Bled for 5 days had a week off bleed again for 6 days had 2 days off and bleeding again! Am considering taking it out. The only good use of it is not worrying about taking a pill everyday, but all these periods are interfering with not only my love life but aswell as my job.",UNK
1610,"I&#039;ve been taking Ambien for many years. The first year, I was prescribed 10 mg nightly. I had experienced a &quot;deep sleep&quot; and through the entire night. For the first time in my life, I didn&#039;t feel exhausted the next day. Then my dosage was changed to 5 mg, which was tough! My tolerance to the higher dose made it not work. My Dr. gave me something different to substitute while my body adjusted. It&#039;s not been 2 years, that I&#039;ve been taking the 5 mg. I also take Adderall XR @ 20 mg daily and 20 mg of Prozac. During the last 6 months, I&#039;ve had difficulty with memory. Being able to recall things I read, appointment times, things people had said to me. I am 52 years old, and I understand that comes with age. But has anyone had similar problems?",UNK
1611,"I had such high hopes for Strattera, but it was completely ineffective and actually made my condition worse. I wanted it to help me focus on work: sending emails, making phone calls, generally being able to work at a computer and other things. I started at 40mg a day, and found myself slightly more tired. I raised it to 60mg a day and seemed to get more tired and less motivated to get anything done. Finally I went to 80mg and still no help with focus. I just found that I was lethargic, unmotivated and tired. I took naps and lazed around, but didn&#039;t get as excited about things as I had before the medicine. My job requires creativity, and it&#039;s hard to be creative if you&#039;re not excited about it. So I actually became LESS productive.",UNK
1612,"I&#039;m a 71 year old woman. Have vertigo and nausea that lasts for months. The Transderm-Scop patch helped off and on, but it is supposed to be worn on the neck and it would itch and leave a rash. So, I tried meclizine. No dizziness, but I can&#039;t get out of bed. Tiredness over comes me. Not sure what to try next.",UNK

1614,"I would be absolutely useless during my period and the pain from my &quot;episodes&quot;, as we have come to call them, would be so bad that I would actually go into shock. I took Yaz for a little over a year and LOVED IT. My periods were nearly pain-free, my skin looked AMAZING (even though it wasn&#039;t horrible before), and I had no definite side effects. I went from needing 2 Acetaminophen and 4 Ibuprofen every four hours or a Hydrocodone (for the pain) to needing nothing! The pain had gone from unbearable to a mild discomfort. I had no change in weight, and my moods were much more stable. My only side effect was mild &quot;rocky&quot; stomach the first few days after initially starting the pill. It worked great for me.",UNK
1615,"I broke out in blisters on face, scalp, and chest. These were oozing a clear sticky fluid that literally melted the skin it oozed over.  Tried everything over the counter and homeopathic but this flesh eating infection would not clear. Finally went to urgent care and was prescribed Bactrim for an assumed MRSA skin infection. Within The first 24 hours I had noticeable improvement. Sores weren&#039;t burning red and swollen, by 3rd day some scabs are already falling off with healthy pink skin underneath, no ooze, no new blisters. Day 5 you would hardly know I had a skin problem. All clear. Only side effect I had was loss of appetite. Didn&#039;t want to eat, nothing sounded good. Lost 4 pounds.  Not everyone reacts bad to Bactrim.",UNK
1616,"I started off with a sample pack of these and then I decided to be prescribed the birth control pills. MY MISTAKE. At first I liked the pill, I didn&#039;t adjust to it long enough I guess for all of the negative side effects to take place. Reading other peoples reviews made me feel A LOT better about what has been happening to me. DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL. I used to be really happy all of the time and I was just starting to lose weight. This pill brought my weight loss to a complete halt.  This pill made me gain some weight back even though I was working really hard toward my weight loss goals. Also, this pill turned me into a crazy person, I get moody and cry for no reason. it is negatively effecting my long time relationship with my boyfriend.",UNK
1617,"Very effective for duodenal ulcer flare up. My only criticism is that they dissolve in your mouth before you can swallow any water to wash then down, and I have almost choked on them, which is very scary. The company needs to provide a thicker coating, even if it delays the quick effectiveness. I just coated one with butter and it went down more smoothly, with lots of ice water, but I still felt it hang up in my esophagus which almost made me gag. I think this could be dangerous. The other night it really scared me, as it got stuck on the way down, and I coughed and gagged and drank water but it was stubborn.",UNK
1618,I have had reactions to three previous medications.I was hopeful with this one because it works differently.  Started on 100 mg. By day 7 I was starting to feel very fatigued 2 hours after taking the pill. Noticed decrease in urination and blurred vision. Symptoms worsened the next couple of days. Lasted 10 days. Guess I go back to my almost carb free diet.,UNK

1620,"I have social anxiety disorder and depression. I never knew how unhappy and stressed I was until I started taking Zoloft early in the year. The drug did wonders for me. It brought out such happiness and a zest for life that I had not felt in a very long time. I began to exercise and eat right and as a result I lost a lot of weight. However, I stopped taking Zoloft mid year because my wife and I are trying to have another baby and it might affect fertility. A few weeks ago I got back on Zoloft for some anxiety I was feeling. I have done one week at 25 mg and the following two weeks on 50, but my anxiety is through the roof and I&#039;m very depressed. I hope it starts to work again, I&#039;m really anxious and praying I get my calm back.",UNK

1623,"The key to using Alli is that you must list everything you eat and not exceed the amount of fat per meal.  I haven&#039;t experienced any side effects and am extremely pleased.  I lost 10 pounds before starting the program and hit a plateau, but since using Alli, I&#039;ve lost 27 more with only 13 pounds to go.  When I reach my ideal weight, I&#039;m going to continue the tracking, eventually weaning myself off of Alli, to be able to maintain my weight.  I don&#039;t expect a quick transition, but love the results.  I recommend trying it, but be diligent to follow the instructions for good results.",UNK
1624,"I am on 10mg of Brintellix, and have been for approximately 2 years. This med is a miracle worker for me, I am more stable than I have ever been. However, as a result I experience severe nausea as well as projectile vomiting, if taken after a large meal it is not as bad; within the hour after taking the medication I either feel like I am going to vomit or barely have time to make it to the toilet before vomiting. This is the one negative of this medication, so I have had to choose to deal with this in order to keep the positive outcome in dealing with my MDD; my whole life has changed since starting Brintellix. Vomiting/Nausea is a small price compared to just not living.",UNK
1625,PTSD. Seemed to help some. Have bit of dizzy loopy for about 15 to 30 minutes after taking then ok. Was taking other meds and got sick and barfed often. Quit taking and nausea stopped.

However, it managed to work very quickly. I was in the restroom within 20 mins after consuming it. No cramping , but I did gag a few times as I was drinking it . I managed to suck on lemons in between sips which also helped a lot. It works but the taste and then drinking the two bottles of water afterwards is tough! Beware.",UNK

CONs- INSOMNIA, no appetite at all started losing weight, muted feelings, had no empathy anymore, like a I don&#039;t give a shit attitude, NO LIBIDO and couldn&#039;t orgasm! 
I decided to quit this garbage and return to the mild Mirtazapine for good.

Friday I was emotional, had down thoughts, I couldn&#039;t follow a time line: I was late for everything. Sunday seemed to be better but not by much. Monday..horrible it was like I added Friday and

I took it 2 times and then I stopped due to the side effects. After the pills my throat does not swallow properly and spitting out thick phlegm is difficult, I almost choked and was out of breath from my own phlegm when I tried to spit it out.

I&#039;m lucky enough to have the meds on-hand due to the recurrent infections - typically only take for 3 days unless I&#039;m seeing blood in my urine, then I take it for 5. Dose 500mg twice in the first day to kick the infection, and then I follow up with 500mg once per day through my 3 or 5 day.

It honestly saved my life.It is so hard to survive this illness when you cant get in under control. I had forgetten what it was like to be myself. I was angry and pissed off at everyone.

I do have them though. For the first month, I would say headaches were pretty bad, but I would take Excedrin.

It also numbed me and made me very indifferent to things.  To cut a long story short I stopped after three months and have changed to Citalopram.

It is useful to many patients who try it and is preferred over similar medications because of its relative safety. Regardless of how it is used, it is very potent and may be habit forming.

But that didnt last long. Eventually my period went away and I didnt experience any side effects. I chose to get off of it because I wanted to have a baby and I got pregnant seriously like a couple weeks after I stopped it. While I was breastfeeding I got on the pill but switched back to the shot. I spotted and bled more when I got the shot after I had the baby but it wasnt to bad.

The removal was actually hurt more) Anyways, the first year I had irregular periods, but no weight gain, no moodiness, no pain during sec, or lack of sex drive-  so that was great. The reason I chose to remove it, is that the last 6 months or so, I had much more spotting, I thought my periods would go away, but they never did, and it became highly unpredictable. I am hoping that if I have to have a period, I&#039;d like to know when it is, even if it&#039;s heavier.

I started this pill in August of 2015 after not having been on the pill for several years.  I read that it would give me lighter periods and since it was low-hormone, it wouldn&#039;t have many side effects.

Do NOT always take what you read as true.

The first 3 months I was on this, my face broke out horribly. I never had problems with acne, even in high school. This pill caused me to have severe breakouts on my chin. Not just pimples or a blackhead here or there, severe welt-like acne underneath the skin&#039;s surface.

To add to that, from August 2015-March 2016 I gained 30 pounds.  There has been no significant change in my diet OR activity level. Triphasil-28/Trivora-28 never caused me these problems!!",UNK

It has been 6 months and I have not gotten a period since stopping the birth control. Before I went on it I had regular monthly cycles, but this birth control messed everything up. Also, about 3 years into taking the pills I started to develop scarring cystic acne that hasn&#039;t gone away even after stopping. This birth control clearly did something to my hormones that I am hoping could be reversed. The only reason why I am giving it any stars is because while I was on it I didn&#039;t have any side effects and periods were super light (when I got them)",UNK

I&#039;ve been the same weight for the past 3 years, and haven&#039;t had any lifestyle/diet changes since I started the pill. I blame Ortho Tri Cyclen. I also have broken out terribly -- my skin has always been pretty good (with the occasional pimple here and there), but since I&#039;ve started this pill ... Yikes. Cyst-like acne all over my chin and cheeks.

I moved up to 10 mg on week two and my anxiety got even worse. I began taking more xanax to combat the increased anxiety and it is making me sick. Now I&#039;m more depressed because the anxiety is crippling me. I am going back to my doctor tomorrow to discuss options. I have tried a number of medications recently all with poor results.

As far as side effects, I got dry lips but Neosporin makes an overnight lip balm that really helps a lot. I use it during the day but really slather it on at night.

I find that I get maximum benefit when I take 120 mg (two 60 mg. capsules at same time) of Cymbalta daily, combined with enough sleep and daily exercise (e.g. at least 20 mins. brisk walking).  Also, I need to avoid/minimize physical and psychological stressors (including unpleasant people).",UNK
1771,"I had the Mirena IUD placed 4 weeks ago. I had heard that the initial placement can be very painful, however, I only felt a very slight ache/pressure when my doc put it in. He even had to manually expand my cervix because it wouldn&#039;t open for him at all. But even with that, it wasn&#039;t bad. I did bleed quite a bit after insertion because he had to pry everything open basically lol. But really not a bad experience. I rated it at an 8 because I&#039;ve been bleeding since about day 5 post insertion. It varies from light spotting to full blown period heaviness from day to day (cramps too) and hasn&#039;t stopped for 3 weeks. Its quite a mood killer :/ but I&#039;d still choose this over the pill, honestly. The bleeding is the only downside for me.",UNK

I never really noticed it until my boyfriend mentioned to me how I never am &quot;in the mood&quot; anymore.  We used to have a very steady sex life together and now maybe 1 time a month.  I went to the doctor a while ago and she ran blood tests on me and they came back that my iron is severely low.  I&#039;ve never had that before until I started taking this pill.  I also seem to get angry very and upset easily. I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s the pills fault but I was never like that before I started taking it.  I started getting regular headaches again, so my Doctor switched me to a different brand that I have yet to try.",UNK

I started again about 3 months ago. While I had no period, crapping, or acne..it caused me to be more anxious than I ever had been. I have barely slept in days, I feel extremely depressed and have a negative outlook on life. This BC ruined me, nausea, leg pain, anxiety and depression. Please be careful if you have a history of anxiety or depression taking this. The mood swings just aren&#039;t worth it. Losing my sex drive and have been pulling away from my boyfriend. I would definitely not recommend this BC to anyone, even someone I hated lol.",UNK

The last day, I had a blood clot the size of my palm.Then the next four days was very very light bleeding. And then back to the heavy flow of numerous clots. It&#039;s been almost 2 months now.

I have tried 2 different RA meds and continued to get sick.  My PCP asked me about my BCP&#039;s and if there were any changes.  A light went off. YES! I am on my 6th week now.  My hormones are wacked, I am irritable, and my stomach is in knots every day.  I have been taking nausea medication almost daily.

The secondary issue is now I have used pens ahead of time in the place of defective ones and my insurance will not authorize more pens ahead of time.  The drug company did agree to do a &quot;&quot;&quot;one&quot;&quot;&quot; time replacement of the two pens.  Getting off now because this tells me I am on my own in the future.",UNK

As soon as I got the injection I knew it was th arimidex that was causing th pain. 4 months later I was getting my hormone injections again. I told her I WOULD NOT take the arimidex.

1781,"Most subtle of the benzos i have tried.  Made me sleepy the first hour or two, but then stabilized anxiety and mood for about 6 hours.  Much longer lasting than it is given credit for.  Good PRN medication.  Other benzos cause some moodiness or depression even.  Although I think Lorazepam can, it is much smoother than others.  It again is too sedating for many people though.  I liked it about as good as Clonazepam, it is better than Valium IMO.",UNK

About 12 years ago I started seeing a psychiatrist who thought I might be bipolar, type 2 (mostly depressive, no full-blown manic state) and started me on Emsam.  It took some time-can&#039;t really remember but maybe a month but it works.  Yes, there are side effects-insomnia being the worst but that dissipated in a few months.  We all know that what works for one person may not for another but this is not an SSRI which can&#039;t &quot;touch&quot; depression associated with bipolar.  And you don&#039;t have to be bipolar for it to work.  I know it&#039;s frustrating but give it a shot-maybe you&#039;ll be like me and never have to try another medicine again!",UNK

Losing my sex drive has been completely terrible, I can&#039;t deal with crippling anxiety any longer, so it was worth it.

I was shocked as my knowledge of the drug was that it had a heavy impact and could cause you to not remember the night you took it. When I got home that night I got ready for bed, took the dose, and laid down. After an hour or so it finally kicked in but all it did was give me a sense of not being in the correct mindset. Just being a bit off. It didn&#039;t help me fall asleep whatsoever. In fact it caused me to remain alert and awake. My results were the complete opposite of its intended use.",UNK

In one month, I&#039;ve lost a total of 21 lbs, dropping from 263lbs to 242lbs, with no other lifestyle changes.

I lowered Cymbalta dose to 30mg a day, an immediate relief from the anxiety. However it crept back,  and I concluded it was an interaction leading to accumulation of Brintellix and went back to 5mg of it. Now after three months I start to get used to that it actually works. Only discomfort is occasionally feeling nauseous (after eating sweets  or pastry on an empty stomach.) 60mg Cymbalta helped me for years with depression and anxiety, however leaving me foggy.

I take benadryl at night to help with insomnia. I&#039;ve had no other adverse effects. It has not decreased my appetite. I also haven&#039;t noticed any changes, good or bad, with  libido. So far, so good. I&#039;ll repost in a month for another update. Good luck!",UNK
1885,"I have used the Dulcolax pink a few times now, and even though it says it gentle, my tummy cramps so bad! It&#039;s just awful when I have to use a laxative. I drink plenty of water so that isn&#039;t the problem. Hopefully I will find a laxative that truly is gentle.",UNK
1886,I&#039;m on Mylans generic version of Generess Fe and so far its been okay. I&#039;ve been on 4 different birth controls in the past year and a half and I was put on this one to try to eliminate a cyst I&#039;ve had since November. While I can say the cyst pain had gone away I have now noticed that I get extremely nauseous on this pill. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just my body adjusting but I feel terrible. I take the pill at 9 every night so I think I have to make sure that I don&#039;t have an empty stomach when I take it. This pill has also made me break out a bit but hopefully that will go away in the next few months.,UNK
1887,"I had my thyroid removed about 2 years ago. I weighed about 190.  I was put on 125 mcg Synthroid right after the surgery.  I lost about 20 pounds without trying at all.  My dosage was increased to 175 mcg.  I then started gaining weight.  My endocrinologist  increased my dosage to 200 mcg.  My weight went up to 224 lbs.  Never weighed so much before.  I&#039;ve been told by a couple of other doctors that the higher doses of Synthroid should cause weight loss, not gain.  I am 72 years old.  In general, I have aches and pains, something wrong every day.  Don&#039;t know if that&#039;s Synthroid related or not.  But I am very uncomfortable with all this weight, just doing everyday things.",UNK
1888,I&#039;m 18 years old. I never been on any other birth control but the 3 months on Depo-Provera...I bled for 2 months as well as depression. I was PMSing the full 2 months. Caused problems in my relationship because of it. ,UNK
1889,Initially my breathing improved but within a few weeks the improvement disappeared.  Within a month I was having major side effects including fatigue and headaches.  My kidney function decreased markedly.  It took weeks after stopping Qvar to recover from the experience.,UNK
1890,I am currently on my second week of this medication and have noticed a decrease in the urge to smoke. I was a pack and a half a day smoker for 25 years and I am down to a half a pack. This is huge for me. I am totally set on quitting and I believe that this drug is going to kick my habit! Will update when medication is complete.,UNK
1891,"First three months I spotted almost everyday, then about the fourth month it leveled out...and then I started getting my period twice a month. My mood swings got so bad that I lashed out in rage at my boyfriend for literally nothing. I cry A LOT...and I have weird pains in my breasts in the same spot that never seem to go away. I still have pretty bad cramps when I&#039;m on my period,  so it didn&#039;t help with that. Besides that,  this pill has been reliable and didn&#039;t change my weight,  sex drive,  or give me acne. I didn&#039;t experience nausea or headaches so that was nice. I would recommend any ladies to at least give it a try,  might work for you.",UNK
1892,"My Mirena has been nothing but a constant source of frustration for the almost two years I have had it. It is now removed. Most prominently, I have always had severe cramping since inserting it (never before was cramping an issue for me). I never really stopped spotting or ever had regular periods. I developed cervical bruising because of it. Nausea was a daily issue. And most recently, I have attended over 10 doctors appointments including three emergency room visits over the course of the last three months, due to ongoing complications with bacterial infections and ovarian cysts resulting in crippling pain. Never before have I had to deal with any of these issues. ",UNK
1893,I suffer from lower back pain. I had a back fusion in November 2013 about 6 months ago I started having really bad back spasms around the area they did the fusion which was my L-5/S-1.  They had me on Flexeril but did not help they tried the Valium and it works. I do not take it every day only when I have the spasms between that and the Percocet it is the only thing that works.  But I only take them as needed.,UNK
1894,"I have been taking Celexa for 4 years.  All of a sudden, it stopped working and I spent 4 days feeling like I didn&#039;t want to live any more.  I had no idea that my body could build up an immunity and it simply would stop working. ",UNK
1895,"I&#039;ve taken one pill of 250mg so far and I&#039;ve had the feeling of throwing up, as well as my boyfriend. I ate a bit before and after and still had that feeling. So far, it&#039;s been working due to no discharge and smell that I usually had. I also don&#039;t have cramps nor burning while urinating.",UNK
1896,I found it to be extremely helpful and love the fact I only have to take it once a week.  I am on my 3rd week now.  The needle size is bigger yes but it does not hurt me to stick myself.  It hurts about the same as poking my finger for my blood sugar meter.  I found through the Bydureon website you can get a card to help with the copay.  Its wonderful to know there are manufacturers that are willing to help those who take their medicines.  Also if you use the freestyle meters you can sign up through Abbot to get a free meter and card to save money on the test strips. ,UNK
1897,I have been taking Effexor XR for approximately 6 months now.  My hot flashes were very severe.  I would be soaked and wet from top of my head down to my legs.  Cold glass of water hardly touched it.  After taking Effexor I only have little sweating around my head and neck maybe two to five times a month.  It is a great relief.,UNK
1898,"I&#039;ve been on Tri-Sprintec for two months. I took this medication to help with my extremely painful periods. I used to have debilitating periods every month but since taking this medication, I&#039;ve had very little or no pain during my period. I didn&#039;t even need to use Ibuprofen. 

I have not gained weight on this pill. 
I have acne and the pill didn&#039;t reduce it so that sucks.
My main side effect of this pill is fatigue. I&#039;ve had a ton of fatigue since taking this but I feel like it&#039;s been getting better.  My breasts before taking this pill was 36C, I feel like my breasts have grown 2 sizes up which is unfortunate for me.

It&#039;s normal to feel nauseous when starting this pill. I take this pill after I eat dinner so I feel that it helps with that",UNK
1899,"I have been on Yaz for a little over 4 months and have been surprisingly happy with it. I had mood swings and was pretty emotional for the first 2 months but it really has gone away. I was also bleeding a little irregularly at first but that also went away. The only complaint I have is that it has killed my sex drive and is causing problems in my relationship. I can&#039;t really ever get wet anymore which never used to be an issue. For that reason, I am switching to Paraguard which is non hormonal. I really wish it didn&#039;t cause me that problem because otherwise I love it!",UNK
1900,"I have no sex drive and I am always spotting.  The spotting has even gotten worse - now I have two periods a month.  I have been taking the pill for almost a year, and the side effects have not subsided - they have gotten worse.  I had to change birth control because of cost,  I guess you get what you pay for....  Sorry Sprintec my body does not like you.",UNK
1901,"I was terrified to get this, but made the decision after I could no longer stand being on my birth control pills anymore due to severe migraines and upper lip pigmentation! The process to get this is quick and painless. However, it was very sore and painful the first few days and it did not fully heal, for me, until about a month. I was nervous about the constant bleeding, as a lot of people reported, but only had a period for ten days than nothing since then. No headaches, weight gain, bloating... The only thing is I find I&#039;m more sensitive and moody, but I don&#039;t know for sure. That could just be because I moved across the country at the same time! I can feel the rod and have a tiny bit of pain once in a great while, but nothing bad. I recommend trying.",UNK
1902,"I have been treated with Lexapro, Zoloft, Pristiq, Klonopin and lamictal and none were effective. I have been taking Cymbalta for about one week now, and still don&#039;t feel any different. I wake up every day feeling 100% anxious and find it extremely hard to get out of bed. It has been this severe for about two months now where I feel totally incapable of living. Doctor said to stay on Cymbalta and see if it changes anything. Feeling hopeful!",UNK
1903,"I&#039;m not perfect with my eating and exercising habits and alas, along with teenage hormones came acne. They&#039;re not horrific, but bad enough to be irritating and painful the week before menstruation. I used to take doxycycline but, even from the beginning, it gave me really bad nausea and headaches. I haven&#039;t noticed anything too bad with the sun exposure on the minocycline but have had more drowsiness and am currently experiencing headaches and dizziness. It cleared up everything along with my use of a Clarisonic and a benzyl-based topical cream. Definitely try it if other tetracyclines didn&#039;t work out for you. This one, despite the side effects, is doing the trick.",UNK
1904,I was on the 20mg patches they made me sick and black out.  I have been reduced to 10mg ones seem to be working good so far in very to little to no pain for the first time in my life these patches are a savior anyone that deals with chronic pain and is on opioid tablets I&#039;d recommend the switch :),UNK
1905,"Tegretol is very effective for my mood swings and hallucinations. It helps slow the racing thoughts and hyperactivity and thinking people are out to get me and helps with hearing voices. When I do not take it, everyone can notice a huge difference in how I act.",UNK
1906,I&#039;m almost due for my 5th shot (almost a year) and I noticed last night that I had some irregular bleeding. Woke up and it had continued. Tad worried but I haven&#039;t had anything like this since I got my 2nd shot so I think I&#039;m okay. Will chat to my GP about it when I go for my shot.,UNK
1907,"If you&#039;re constipated and you&#039;re considering taking this medication, DON&#039;T. It works at relieving constipation, but the side affects are horrible. Do yourself a favor and Google home remedies for constipation, or visit your local whole food store for help to finding a solution.",UNK
1908,"I had my paragard inserted in the office in June of 2015. Per my OB it was in place at my 6 week check up. In the first 4 months after insertion I had moderate to severe cramping and was informed by my OB that this was normal. In June 2016 my IUD was no longer visible in my cervix. An ultrasound was scheduled. Four days later I had a positive pregnancy test. The ultrasound confirmed the pregnancy and the IUD was not visible so was assumed to have fallen out. I gave birth in February of 2017. A follow up X-ray and subsequent  hysterectomy confirmed the paragard was still in my body, but not in my uterus. I had my Paragard surgically removed in October 2017 and it was found to have perforated my uterus and small intestine.",UNK

1910,Everyone here has been complaining about this medication which has gotten me a little anxious as I am in the process of waiting for the effect. I took two tablets at around 6pm and around 9:30 my stomach was grumbling insanely passing wind for about half an hour. I melting toilet thinking I needed to go but i didn&#039;t. Then all of a sudden around 10pm I was in so much pain I was crouching down from the cramps and went straight to the bathroom and had a bowel movement. i am aware I might get a few more bowel movements throughout the night but at this moment I&#039;m hoping the pain isn&#039;t as unbearable as earlier before. Right now I feel quite relaxed after the first session on the toilet. Honestly feeling great after taking it.,UNK
1911,"I&#039;m on the low dose, even though I&#039;ve been diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Even on the lose dose, there were days where I would go 10 times or I would have diarrhea.  My doctor didn&#039;t want to take me off it though, because this is the only thing that really has worked.  I have noticed, that the amount of water I drink while taking it/before my meal, can affect it. My doctor also thought adding a probiotic might help settle it down a bit.  I&#039;ve started taking the probiotic with Lizness and since then, I&#039;ve had more normal bowel movements.  Some days I do have more than one now, but 2-3 is not bad.  I highly suggest trying the probiotics (colon health) before discontinuing due to having too many bowel movements or diarrhea. ",UNK
1912,"I had very bad experience with Ditropan (Oxybutynin in tablets) with unacceptable side effects. After some years my GP suggested trial of Oxybutynin patches. That was the second best thing after sliced bread. Within 2 days I went from up to 6 wetting incidents per 24 hours to 0 and in the following weeks a substantial reduction in the leaking of urine. I have now used Oxytrol for 5 weeks and the only side effect is severe constipation, which seems to be helped by changing the Oxytrol patch every 5 days instead of 3 or 4. I have no other side effects, no dry mouth, no sensitive skin where the patches have been sitting on either side of the body. So I am a very satisfied user, no more large pads, nappies, PVC pants just a normal size Tena pad.",UNK
1913,"Finally, I no longer have to chose between falling asleep at night or being productive during the day.  With Sonata, I can do both.  The only drawback is that on rare occasions, the medication takes awhile to work.",UNK
1914,"This med works for anxiety but....I have been on sooo many meds.  I need it more for anxiety than depression and that is why I chose Zoloft.  It does work for the anxiety only.  Problem after taking it for a couple years is my sleep is so disrupted, I clench my jaw so bad that when I wake up I have headaches, as well as my body.  I find myself all clenched up in a ball and then my body is sore from being tense, and feel foggy headed.  Newest problem is memory issues.  I guess it is this meds.  The sex was affected some... no weight gain.  Of course when you start any medicine, you have the normal, sweating, nauseous, dray mouth, but those things go away.  You have to give all medicines time to work!!!  I am going to wean off &amp; onto Cymbalta",UNK

From day one, I have been experiencing all sorts of awful side effects: numbness in all extremities and face, fainting, problems with breathing, headaches, weakness and dizziness to the point that I couldn&#039;t drive to work. I ended up in hospital, twice.
I never had issues in the past with birth control pills, but this one is not suitable for me, while thousands of women are fine taking it.
If you experience bad side effects, Please interrupt your treatment and see your doctor asap. Birth control pills shouldn&#039;t cause major side effects, and if they do it&#039;s a clear sign that you are at risk and must look for a better option!!",UNK

I&#039;m 18 years old and I&#039;ve never had a baby, I got the Mirena to use as a form of birth control. I took 880 mg of aleve 1 hour before my appointment and the whole process took maybe 10 minutes. I&#039;ve only had one Pap smear before and she even had to dilate me a little bit but it didn&#039;t hurt worse than my worst period cramps- you just have to breathe through it. I had light spotting for the rest of the day and some mild cramps that felt better when I laid down and used a heating pad. Now I&#039;m in no pain at all and I am happy and have energy and am VERY happy that I got this done!",UNK

Severe migraines, acne, needing to eat everything, mood swings, depression, etc. I am not pregnant and was happy with the pill besides the weight gain.

1925,"5 yrs ago, I got Amerge after trying almost every other medication available. My migraines tend to come back within 4-6 hours with Imitrex, but the Amerge would keep it gone. Unfortunately, I had a really hard time getting my insurance to cover it. Another good thing about the Amerge is that it didn&#039;t seem to have the photophobia effect after I took it. Also wouldn&#039;t knock me out or make me feel groggy. It was like taking a vitamin and then my life could just go on as planned! I really hope that insurance companies get better at covering effective medications for their patients. I also wish I could just afford the $200 or whatever for 9 pills. ",UNK

I would have a snippet playing nonstop for WEEKS!  Day and night (kept me awake until I fell asleep from exhaustion).  Played at work CONSTANTLY where I couldn&#039;t focus.  I would be in meetings unable to pay attention because I would have a song blaring over and over in my head.  After ramping up doses, I settled at 100mg/day of Zoloft which has SAVED MY LIFE!

I have had it for 3 months now and I am a person that will try something for as long as possible before I have had enough. Lower back pain, painful cramps, period that lasts 2 weeks where I bleed through super tampons in two hours, and spotting for the other 2 weeks. Crouching down for longer then 30 seconds as well as sitting on hard chairs means having painful cramps for the day. For this much pain, not worth it. Does prevent pregnancy though.",UNK

1945,I&#039;m a medical doctor and all I can say is this is the first time I&#039;ve taken an irritant laxative and wow. I actually contemplated calling an ambulance when it hit me with intense hypogastric pain which obviously irritated a sacral nerve as my feet started to throb in pain while my bowels viciously spasmed. I should have known better and taken a hyperosmotic like movicol. First attack was 6hrs later followed by another after 2hrs. I thought this is what death must be like. I was out for the day with exhaustion and dehydration and will never take this again. I&#039;d rather have a colleague give me an enema in future. Take with caution.,UNK

At first I did often worry about it &quot;slipping&quot; out or my boyfriend feeling it during sex, but none of those things happened. The only down side so far has been the nausea I get in the mornings. It usually goes away after I eat and start my day, but other than that, everything is great.",UNK

My periods have been very scheduled and fairly regular which was great until 4-5 months ago when I missed a period then was on time the following 2 months. Last month I started a week early and it was unusually light, this month I started 2 1/2 weeks early and it has been off and on spotting for the past 5 days. I did call the helpline when I missed my period. They did not seem to concerned and I have not been able to find ANYwhere the birth rates on this specific birth control! I loved it until a year ago so the first half of my experience was great the last half no.",UNK
1948,Symbicort works well as a maintenance medication for my COPD. I use in combination with Spiriva. The only down side is that it causes anxiety and &quot;jitters&quot; for me. I am already an anxious person so this can be a problem.,UNK
1949,I had my Implanon put in February 2011 I only had a period the first month then never had one again. Only thing I didn&#039;t like was the pain in my arm. But otherwise it was great it didn&#039;t give me any problems and I didn&#039;t gain much weight and the sex never changed. ,UNK

I also ended up losing feeling in the right side of my body. Turns out it was from SMOKING WHILE TAKING THE PILL. I stopped taking it and after a 2 weeks FINALLY got to my regular self. Please be careful because smoking while on the pill can be deadly.",UNK

The first week, my neck and back muscles were so sore, they hurt to the touch.  It was as if the muscles not paralyzed were competing for the jobs of those that were.  I have never felt such pain.  Each morning, different muscles would be in pain.  The diffuse, large muscle pain has improved somewhat now 3 weeks out, but my neck muscles feel as if they cannot support my head.  It causes me severe pain to bend forward to read, eat, try to pick things up.  I am going to try PT this week.  Also have had 7 migraines in 3 weeks since treatments.  Very sad patient here!",UNK

I stopped taking it yesterday and my vision is still not 100%. I recommend people try this for a day and observe your bodies reaction. Lots of people have a bad reaction to this medication (Ive NEVER had a reaction to medication in my life only this one). If your sensitive to certain medication I highly recommend you don&#039;t take this one.",UNK
1958,"I have just begun Trileptal as a treatment for Bipolar I. I was previously on Seroquel 150 and was unable to function at all within 45 minutes of taking it. I experience rapid cycling and more manic episodes than depressive ones and so the Seroquel helped me sleep. However, I noticed weight gain almost immediately and immense hunger-almost ravenous. When it would wear off I was extremely hostile and agitated. The side effects seemed to outweigh the benefits. So far Trileptal has left me with no side effects except for a slight headache and I have smoothly transitioned out of my manic episode. I feel like I may need a sleep aid however- still experiencing a bit of insomnia.  I can only hope the success continues!",UNK
1959,"This drug has been a lifesaver to me. It&#039;s helped provide me with an antidepressant effect, whereas lithium only controlled the mania part of my mood. I use this in combination with other drugs and so far there hasn&#039;t been any side effects. Within 3 weeks the effects peaked. I would definitely recommend this drug. This has made a difference in my mood, the way I think, and my overall perspective. This improved my motivation to get work done, since I wouldn&#039;t be just sitting around reminiscing in a negative thought loop. It gives me mental freedom and allows me to escape brain fog that has imprisoned my thoughts. Seriously, don&#039;t be afraid to try this drug.",UNK
1960,"My daughter has A.D.D. so we tried Concerta. At first it was fine I thought there was hope for my daughter but after two months my daughter started to get angry and really bad mood swings Super emotional.

Tried Prozac and didn&#039;t notice a difference for 2 weeks, then slowly started feeling calmer and could somewhat focus on tasks and errands. I started supplements, vitamin D3 and fish oil. Felt more relief with this combination of Prozac and supplements. Noticed a lift of mood and sleep was once again welcomed instead of torture. I had severe insomnia during my Depression. All I can say is I&#039;ve been on this combination for 5 almost 6 years and felt much better. My heart goes out to anyone suffering from this illness.",UNK

When I increased the dose as prescribed the second week I developed a headache the next day. Had pains in my abdomen, all throughout my back. Continued for 2 more weeks then my body shut down, had the worst migraine that lasted 2 days. I slept for 4 days. Then muscle weekness, nausea, and persistent headache. My bladder was painful and felt like I could not empty it. Three days off them, I can finally stand up straight, but I lost a week of work.

Might have been ok if dose was not increased.",UNK

This is the only Blood Pressure medicine so far that I feel good and normal, no pressure in head or headaches, Blood Pressure good, UNTIL I start with severe pain mainly in my upper and lower back but also my neck, which eventually ends up in muscle weakness.  This has happened numerous times over the past two years. Thus the stopping and starting again. I play tennis a few times a week, but when the weakness starts, I am in so much pain that I cannot play again for several days and eventually will start experiencing muscle strains or pulls or just can&#039;t adequately move my legs to run.  Avapro, Benicar and Crestor caused the same problems.",UNK
1966,"I am just finishing my second week taking Contrave and have lost 10 lbs. It has been an interesting experience because the drug is definitely not an appetite suppressant, yet it does help you control the urge to eat. I have had mild side effects - some stomach discomfort and slight headaches along with constipation, but it has all been easily manageable. If you are considering taking this medication please keep in mind that you still need to do the work by exercising and eating right, but the medication really does help. It has helped me get my motivation back to exercise, and it definitely helps with cravings to eat making it easy to just eat what I need to be healthy. Use the coupon they give you, it drops cost to $70",UNK
1967,I started this 2 weeks ago. I have mixed manic bipolar disorder. I was on latuda and Risperdal for 3 years. I finally got off of them after the doctor realized it was messing with me. On vraylar I noticed I sleep less like only 8 hours instead of 10-12. I also feel better I don&#039;t hear voices anymore and I felt good enough to cut and color my hair. 2 weeks ago that would&#039;ve been out if the question. I&#039;ve started exercising and I&#039;ve noticed the side effect of restlessness. I hope it goes away! Overall this is a wonder drug!,UNK
1968,"I took this when I had acute externa otitis media. My ear was hurting really badly and it was swelled up. I couldn&#039;t sleep on the side of the affected ear, couldn&#039;t open my jaw wide enough to eat/yawn. It was horrid. I was prescribed 10 tabs (twice a day) and after my prescription, the swelling reduced significantly and also my skin looks amazing. I do not have any side effects. But I love what this medicine has done to my skin especially. I do get very bad breakouts at time, especially when I keep my make up on for too long. Even my colleagues commented on how clean my face looks at the moment. ",UNK
1969,"I took Zoloft as a teenager for depression and experienced paranoia and heard voices. As an adult, I tried Zoloft again for anxiety and depression as my doctor thought I had outgrown the previous side-effects. This time I felt an increase in anxiety, nervousness, and paranoia (which I did not experience on any other medicines). It did help lift the depression but it was not a calming medication and I would not recommend it for anxiety.",UNK
1970,"Switched from Adderall to Vyvanse because I was experiencing negative side effects. Even on the smallest dose of Adderall I was anxious, had trouble with public speaking, and would have pretty bad mood swings. On Vyvanse I finally feel like a &#039;normal&#039; person. My mom noticed a difference on the first day, and I no longer feel hopeless and discouraged while doing school work.",UNK
1971,"I&#039;ve been on Contrave for 60 days. The first week was terrible. I was so sick I didn&#039;t think I could continue. And it happened again after increasing the dose. The side affects have subsided but every so often I do something really stupid like using conditioner before the shampoo or forget to rinse the shampoo before leaving the shower. All this said, I feel fine and it&#039;s working. I&#039;m down 12 pounds. I do have trouble with my scale. If I bump it at all my weight changes dramatically. If I move it, it looks like I&#039;ve gained as much 10 pounds overnight. The auto response text messages are pretty worthless. I have tried reaching out to the email support address be there has not been any response. Overall, I&#039;ll keep taking it.",UNK

Best part of all no side effects what so ever.",UNK
1974,I&#039;ve been on risperidone for 10 years. The positive is that it controlled my mania quickly in hospital. The negitive is that as a maintenance antipsychotic it&#039;s caused tension and spasm in my hands and legs. This has been helped by lower doses but then it only has to increase when my mood elevates.,UNK

I have been on &quot;gold&quot; injections (5 years) and Metotroxite, and Predisone for another 5 or 6 years.  Eight years ago, I went on Humira for a few months.  It was helpful only for a few days and then the rest of the week was too painful.  I then switched to Enbrel, at first 25 mg twice a week, and now 50 mg once a week.  It has been wonderful - I still have joint soreness if I over-do, and  need to take a muscle relaxer at night, but I am so much better.   I worry that it may start to be less effective, but so far, I&#039;m loving it",UNK
2007,"Worse medicine ever,  side effects are bad,  severe headache, dizziness, fever, insomnia, nausea, loss of appetite,  needle pain all over the body....sure it relieves uti symptoms but side effects are worse, I&#039;m on day 2 of 3 but I don&#039;t want to keep talking it....",UNK
2008,I have had baby since I was 17 years old and I am now 34. I&#039;ve had it basically every day. I take my medicine it goes away and it comes right back the doctor told me that there is absolutely nothing he can give me to get it to clear up completely. I found that taking the medicine with milk prevent that nasty taste in your mouth It Coats your mouth and then also coach your stomach so it helps with the nausea. This is my probably 30th or 4th time taking this medicine and it seems to not be working at all this round I might have a yeast infection I don&#039;t know? But let me tell you ladies I have suffered with this for more than half my life. I get it with sex protected and unprotected and even if he pulls out I hope you girls can find something,UNK
2009,"I am suffering from acne for more than 7 years. I took different medications(capsules,creams,ointments) none of them have good impact. This year June I went to a dermatologist on my friends suggestion, he prescribed Isotretinoin 20mg 1 capsule per day for 10 days in a month. Its been 4 months now, except a few breakouts acne is under control.",UNK
2010,Had surgery and they had me put this on to minimize secretions and for nausea. It worked amazing while it was on as I was taking pain meds and went under general anesthesia. I was suffering from very bad vision though and it was quite alarming how I couldn&#039;t even read simple things. The day I took it off I threw up multiple times and had EXTREME nausea and dizziness. For two days straight I slept all day and night because it was too miserable to be awake. It took a good three or more days for me to not feel nauseous anymore. My mom also experienced a similar rebound effect. It works good for while you&#039;re on it but be careful because some people get these adverse effects like me!,UNK
2011,"I have been on this for three months, no serious side effects. I am very super sensitive to statins so I had to get off of them.

2012,I know this isn&#039;t what you wanted to hear but this is what I have to say. The doctor is most likely going to tell you to stay on it for 6-8 weeks. At least that&#039;s what they told me. Well this medicine for the first week will make you super dry but it stops soon. And after that nothing happens. Just get on a pill. Epiduo does not work at all for me,UNK
2013,"I was terrified of starting birth control due to the horror stories I had heard from other women in the past. I am a small person, and due to this, I had very irregular periods. I would suffer from premenstrual syndrome for weeks on end before my period would actually start. Most times, I would have to take a Progestin supplement to actually get my period. This started happening more and more often and started really affecting my life. I spoke to my doctor and she put me on Cryselle. This has changed my life. It&#039;s been 3 and 1/2 months and I have had no side effects, no weight gain and my period is regular/short every month. It&#039;s given me the positive change I needed so badly!",UNK
2014,"While I enjoy not having a period and knowing I am protected from pregnancy without having to take a pill everyday I am having my Mirena removed Thursday. I have only had it 6.5 months and in that time I have had a constant dull back pain, uncontrollable acne and I have also gained 25 pounds. Mirena is just not for me.",UNK
2015,"I&#039;ve been using Lamictal for over five years, sometimes with other medicines but mostly by itself.  I&#039;ve been at most dosage levels at one time or another up to 800mg near the beginning of my treatment.  Everything always comes back to Lamictal alone.  I recently got switched to the generic, lamotrigine, and I like it better than the Brand.  Everything is a bit &quot;milder&quot; with lamotrigine, including the side effects.",UNK
2016,"I really really wanted to LOVE the Mirena. I had inserted on February 14, 2011 (yes Valentine&#039;s day) and finally had it removed today. It definitely made my period&#039;s lighter, but I also had 2 a month, every month at 9 days each. Typically my period is fairly heavy but only 5 days and only once a month. That was complaint #1. I was constantly bloated, and gained 19 lbs despite working out and dieting. My biggest complaint is that I had huge emotional/horomonal issues with this. Everything from random crying, to just being extremely emotional, even depressed at times. I am a fairly happy person normally. I had the Mirena removed and replaced with a Paragard. I really like the aspects of the IUD and not having to worry regularly.",UNK
2017,I had h pylori so after finishing the tripple therapy i was put on ompeezole 20 mg per day. This my third month. I had depression and anxiety.

I am confused  is it side effect of this medicine or I am really going crazy,UNK
2018,"Started taking Tramadol (50/mg) for a bulging disc that was discovered after an X-ray and MRI in 2011.  I didn&#039;t take 50 mg/day consistently until November. Tramadol worked extremely well for my back pain and elevated my mood quite a bit.  (Always a great thing for the husband and kids.)  I stopped taking it altogether 3 days ago because I&#039;m convinced it lowered my libido and it was making me gain a few pounds.  I&#039;m not a big person at 5&#039;2&quot; and 112lbs.  Someone had told me that it does aid in weight gain. The side effects of withdrawal are true and include (for me anyway): body aches, irritability, mood swings, sweating and dizziness. Unfortunately, my back pain has returned.",UNK
2019,"Well, today makes day 2 of taking Contrave. I am on Spring Break and want to monitor my side effects. Day 1 I was still hungry and with cravings. Day 2 took around 10 a.m made eggs with cheese, salmon croquette with a biscuit. I was only able to eat 1/3 of the egg..no biscuit, and took me 30 minutes to each a small portion of the salmon.

I can&#039;t feel the ring, neither can my partner, and it has never fallen out. Slightly dryer than usual, but not disturbingly. Other than that, I&#039;m completely normal; no acne, no mood change, no weight gain, nothing. I love it.",UNK
2021,"Took this about three days into a pretty bad cold to relieve congestion especially in my sinuses...worked a charm! Took the adult dose around noon that day. didn&#039;t have the same jittery side effects some are reporting and was, thankfully, able to take a nap that afternoon with the sinus relief it provided. my mom on the other hand says she can&#039;t take it after noon or else she won&#039;t sleep all night, so I understand your pain! All in all, worked great for me but understand that some people (for whatever reason) might have trouble sleeping if taken too late in the day",UNK
2022,"Last year when I had back pain my GP prescribed this medicine. It worked very well and I have no side effects. I stopped taking the medicine after the pain decreased and gradually disappeared.

2023,"Just started Mecliizine 25mg 3 days ago to treat vertigo condition. Works great, but it makes me so sleepy. I take it before bed now, and only once per day, as opposed to the recommended 6 to 8 hours.

Do not recommend can put you back to square one.",UNK
2025,"Lactulose does not work at all.  I got it in the ER and was told to go home and continue taking it.   I finished the whole big bottle days ago and still nothing.   Before the lactulose I tried all the over the counter pills, psylium husk, fleet enemas, suppositories, magnesium citrate etc for 2 weeks.  It&#039;s now approaching 3 weeks and still nothing.  At least the mag citrate made me gassy and I felt belly rumblings like there was something trying to happen on but with lactulose no gas, bloating, nothing happening at all.",UNK
2026,"I got the arm insert because I have had bad experiences with estrogen based pills on the past and since it uses a different hormone and has little chance of adverse reactions I felt good about the decision. However I seemed to be part of the 3rd of the population that had side effects. I had a little over 3 months and it was miserable!! 5 pounds in the first week and over 15 since, not to mention the awful mood swings, I have never had a history of depression but while on it I would randomly feel miserable, like the hopeless kind of depression, I broke out and just generally wanted to crawl out of my skin, I had it removed yesterday, felt the same as going in and I&#039;m hopeful my body will return to normal with time.",UNK
2027,"I have been on this medication for about a week now. I am a type 1 diabetic. My sugars are extremely on the high side. It was like overnight it raised my sugars terrible. It has the complete opposite affect, my mind races. I pace , no sleep for me. So I think I need to be done with this. The not taking it verses the side effects. And I don&#039;t need this. So diabetics beware.",UNK

2029,"I took the pill (awful to swallow) form for about 2 1/2 months...(per a pharmacist- I dissolved it in about an ounce of cold water, stir and chug it then drink about 8ounces of cold water.). They dissolve it about ten seconds and have a nasty chalky taste but it has healed my gastritis which was extremely painful. It started helping in about a week but took two months altogether to heal.  The side effects were nausea, back and neck pain, constipation.... lost weight because I was so sick before I started taking it. Good luck everyone.",UNK
2030,"I have the most painful &quot;girl issues&quot; that you could imagine.  I would have to go to the ER to get a shot of a narcotic for the pain. NOTHING ELSE helped, until the best doctor in the world prescribed Toradol.  It is the only non-narcotic to help with the cramps.",UNK
2031,"After about 3 months or so, all of the side effects that I was having disappeared.  It works great for my PMS, anxiety and even helps me to think clearer (ADD).  Just be patient.  One thing that I don&#039;t like is the weight gain, but plump and happy is better than thin and cranky.",UNK
2032,"I got this inserted May 20th and spotted for a weekish. My period stopped for about 2 weeks.... but since then (almost 4 months) I&#039;ve had my period every damn day. It&#039;s not heavy, but its new blood and old blood. Luckily my bf doesn&#039;t mind, but it&#039;s so inconvenient and frustrating. Everyday I tell myself i&#039;m going to remove it, but in the back of my mind i feel like if i just wait it out a little bit longer it will stop. I&#039;m starting to think the bleeding will continue and i&#039;m not sure if i should take it out and start another pill, but if i do that will i have to experience another 4 months of bleeding. Anyways, my skin was good before i put it in, then i broke out and nowwww it&#039;s clearing up... No weight change..MOOD SWINGS YES!",UNK
2033,"I am on the pill Trinessa but took an antibiotic, Cyprofloxacin, for a urinary tract infection a week before having sex with my boyfriend. He didn&#039;t use a condom and I heard that antibiotics can make the pill less effective so I was super paranoid and scared that I would get pregnant. So about 16 hours after sex I took Next Choice One Dose. Right after I took it I had a headache but that&#039;s it. Didn&#039;t have any other symptoms for several days after. Since I am on the pill I know exactly when I am supposed to get my period. I felt menstrual cramps and fatigue for a couple of days before the day my period was supposed to start. I had light bleeding and cramps on the day it was due. Relax &amp; good luck",UNK
2034,TO ANYONE FOR WHOM THIS HAS NOT WORKED WELL:  this didn&#039;t work for me at all...until I trimmed my armpit hair significantly. Try it! I did not shave it as I knew this would cause serious irritation. I just used hair trimming shears and trimmed it down to basically nothing. Now this has gone from doing nothing to working almost perfectly.  Before you give up hope (and I know how hopeless this condition makes one feel) give this a shot; I assume it works because the medicine is absorbed better.,UNK
2035,"I have been taking this medication for 9 weeks now. I injured my lower back and will require a spinal fusion of L5-S1 and L4-L5. I will be waiting for this surgery to get approved for a long time. This medication help quite a bit with all the pain associated with my back, except the nerve pain. Thank God the nerve pain is intermittent. I have noticed that the longer I take it, the less amount of relief time I get. That is to say, when I started taking it I would get about 6 hours of relief. That time started shortening rather quickly down to 2 hours now. My doctor put me on Tramadol at the same time now. I alternate taking 2 of each every 3-4 hours and the relief is amazing. I get about 75% pain relief with that combo, Versus about 50%.",UNK
2036,"I was on the Depo shot for about 3 yrs and went off it (only because it is recommended to take breaks from it) and went on Yaz.

I got off it after 3 months and am about to try Sprintec...here&#039;s hoping this works out better!",UNK

Emergency room declared I had a severe allergic reaction to Celexa. ,UNK
2038,"2 years ago I had it inserted. There was some intense cramping during the &quot;sound&quot; and the actual insertion, but it took less than five minutes, and there was no pain, but slight discomfort, for the rest of the day. I got my period a week early and it was much heavier than before (used to be light 6 days, changed to EXTREMELY heavy 5 days). My period has gotten less extreme over time, and now it is EXTREMELY heavy for 3 days. It took a few months to not feel it at all. Occasionally (once every 6-9 months) sex is too rough and I get stabbing pain in uterus for a few days, but other than that I am able to tell my partner when it is too rough and I don&#039;t have any pain. Partner felt it once in the 2  years I&#039;ve had it. 8/10 for the heavy periods",UNK
2039,Lithium was hard for me to take at first. If I did not eat enough with the medicine I would vomit. The medicine works for me but I do not like the fact that I have gained weight and it causes acne. I have done everything I can to have clear skin but it does not matter what I do. Lithium is cheap and effective but like I said I don&#039;t like the side effects. I am going to try Tegretol when I go back to the Doctor.,UNK
2040,"Had 3 panic attacks in total..last one was big. So I went to the doctor, I was thinking I was having a stroke! After that experience I was very anxious! I could not learn or do anything! I was a mess for about a few weeks. So I my psychologist said I have Generalized anxiety disorder and of my passing of my father a few years ago and bullying in school lead to all this. I started with Lexapro and after 3 days I stopped it made me feel so sick and I had university exams coming up so I started it again  3 weeks ago and the strange thing is I have little side effects! First day I struggled with sleeping and I tend to feel tired in the morning and afternoon, But I hope that&#039;s goes away soon. Anxiety is much better. I&#039;m on 10mg. Waiting for my best results at 4-8 weeks!",UNK
2041,I tried Nuvaring in Oct 2012 and stopped it July 2013 because of mood swings and bloating.  I decided to try a pill and got severe anxiety attacks.  Went back on the Nuvaring in Sept 2013 and all was fine for the first 2 months but month 3 I got my mood swings back and I am so irritable that any tiny thing annoys me.  Sadly I stopped it because I can&#039;t take the anger from it and I know it is the Nuvaring because I&#039;ve only been angry while on it.  It&#039;s too bad because it actually helped my anxiety and it was so convenient. Going to try a chewable pill next.,UNK
2042,"I&#039;ve had this IUD since April 2017. The initial issue was bleeding for about a week but other problems in the long run for me are the mood swings, feeling deep depression, and the slight weight gain. Even after eating right &amp; working out I wasn&#039;t able to lose any weight while having this IUD in me unlike when I didn&#039;t have it in me I could lose weight fast. I do have periods but they aren&#039;t as heavy and very irregular. For me this IUD does it&#039;s job. I haven&#039;t gotten pregnant at all while on it. It&#039;s good to get if you aren&#039;t trying to get pregnant of course but be sure to do your research in advance &amp; review others side affects to it before getting it which I wish I did but didn&#039;t.

It makes me not hungry for hours. Even a small granola bar can keep me satisfied and full for 5-6 hours... But I force myself to have breakfast lunch and dinner.

The Fentanyl patch has been great. I don%u2019t have the ups and downs in pain because I forgot to take the pills at a certain time. My pain is well controlled with little breakthrough pain and the side effects are far less than the oxycodone alone. I wish I had this a year ago. I see bright days ahead.,UNK

2059,Me and my boyfriend had unprotected sex the second day of my period. 20 to 24 hours later I took Plan B. I had nausea select days over a week or two then everything seemed back to normal. Two days after I had unprotected sex my period stopped. Plan B works three different ways one of them being telling your body not to ovulate. Well 11 days after my period stopped I was due to ovulate. Plan B more than likely told my body not to ovulate at that time because my period was 9 days late. I&#039;m also overweight by a couple pounds to where Plan B effectiveness starts to fade. I think because I was ovulating close to when I took Plan B it told my body to wait to ovulate. Today I got my period. Thank goodness!!,UNK

I&#039;ve been prescribed all the usual medicines: antibiotics, birth control pills, various topical creams and really, nothing has made any significant improvement. When I turned 40, 4 months ago I decided after doing extensive research, to ask my doctor about spironolactone. Since I&#039;m not looking to become pregnant, she thought we could give it a try. So I&#039;ve been on 50mg once a day for 4 months and this medicine has completely changed my life. My skin is not oily anymore and my cystic acne in my back is gone. My face is clear of acne. No side effects. But why didn&#039;t any dr/dermatologist prescribe this for me years ago?",UNK
2065,"I have been on Cymbalta (30mg) for a three week trial for treating my anxiety, depression and fibromyalgia. Thought it sounded like a miracle pill since I&#039;m only 21 years old, but this has caused everything from headaches to stomach pain to diarrhea. I figured I could live with that and let it run its course but things got worse. I noticed my anxiety attacks got much worse and became more frequent, had to go the ER last night because my hands, feet, tongue, ears, face went numb and swelled. Now I&#039;m on steroids and Benadryl to bring it down. ",UNK

I was stage 1 with radiation and unable to take Tamoxifen due to being on antidepressants for some length of time. My oncologist and I will decide what direction to take at the end of March.

My doctor here in South Australia tried different medications including morphine pain patches and oxycontin which did slightly help. I had two cortisone injection in my lower spine which worked,  the pain went. Yeah  4 weeks later, I developed severe chronic peripheral neuropathy i.e. muscle leg cramps.  I started out on 150 mg Lyrica and now 300mg. The Lyrica makes me tired so I do not drive unless I stop taking it the day before. My wife massages my legs for 15 mins morning and night.

Took one dose at night, and almost fainted when I awoke and tried to get up, which is a know side effect but it took 16 hours to get back to where I could walk and I was pounding liquids the whole time.  Should be more clearly designated.  My HR was up in the 110  range and my resting rate is 60 normally.",UNK

2071,"I have not been on Methadone for a great amount of time but i have been on it long enough to find that the pain free result IS NOT worth the life ruining effects its having on me.

I can&#039;t work anymore, I can&#039;t maintain most social relationships anymore, and I am so isolated and lonely now which is having serious deteriorating effects on my mental health condition!!! I have never hated another drug more than this one.

Well the bleeding has been nonstop, slightly heavy. I&#039;m not really sure if I like it or not. My ob, by her own choice had to numb me and give me a shot for pain right before I had it inserted.  I&#039;m not really sure if this is normal. I have acne now haven&#039;t had it since I was 18, I&#039;ve gained weight and I get sleepy very easily now.",UNK

2074,My doctor suggested gabapentin for my leg cramps/restless legs and insomnia.  I was unable to sit for any period of time without my legs causing discomfort and would have very painful leg cramps.  I would find it hard to get to sleep and would wake up at 2 or 3 am every night. I have been taking gabapentin for a month and am very pleased....I have not experienced any of the severe symptoms that have been described by others.,UNK
2075,Out of nowhere I started having premature ejaculation problems so a doctor prescribed anafranil. The drug definitely worked and after I stopped taking it after a couple of months my problems were gone. The drug did make me feel pretty queasy and out of it (I threw up once) but it was as if my sex life was rebooted and my body trained to orgasm later. I recommend but don&#039;t drive or do anything important while on the drug.,UNK

2077,"I&#039;ve been on this medication for almost 8 years now, and could not imagine going off of it. When I first started on carbemazepine, I could tell the difference within a few weeks. My mood swings became less volatile and it gives me a &quot;buffer period&quot; between actions and my reactions so that I am able to think about what is happening and react in an appropriate way. Weight gain and sexual side effects have not been a problem for me with this medication either.",UNK
2078,"So thankful for this website, it definitely eased my mind prior to the prep and procedure! Overall this experience was pretty easy and pain free. The Suprep was pretty gross (salty, grape flavor) and the 1st bottle is much easier going down then the 2nd. I did throw up with both, but managed to keep most of it down. It worked and worked quickly! Best advice I read was to eat lightly a couple days prior and it made things so much easier and tolerable. Kept plenty of fluids (Gatorade, ginger ale, apple juice) butterscotch candy and chicken broth. As far as procedure, I was beyond nervous and it was complete cake! Staff was great, explained step by step, gave me meds (completely sedated) and next thing I knew it was over and I was awake!",UNK
2079,"I have been medically treating my Bipolar Disorder for 11 years. Finding the right medication and the proper doses is tremendous work. You may find that seroquel is not helping you but that may not be true, you may not have  found the right dose and inital side effects do subside. I take 900mg lithium/400mg seroquel /400mg lamotragine. Up until 2013 I was in/out of serious episodes that would last for months and destroy my life. I was taking 150mg of seroquel and my doc was hesitant to increase my dose. This increase of dose saved me. I am no longer controlled by this disease, rarely have episodes. I do hate seroquel for sedation/panic attacks at night, lucid nightmare, weight gain. BUT I have my life back and the negatives are so worth it!",UNK
2080,I was 14 when my doctor put me on this garbage for extreme periods (3+ weeks of bleeding) and if anything my periods got worse after being on this. It also gave me CONSTANT cramps. I would have cramps every single day and when I was on my period they were just way worse. I was taking way too many ibuprofen a day and they eventually stopped working for me. No other pain killer could even put a dent in the pain from these cramps. The only thing that helped was my left over vicodin from surgery. I was 100 lbs and taking high doses of vicodin just to go to school. Doctor made me continue to take it for 6 months despite horrible pain. Nothing changed. Thankfully off it now please don&#039;t take this drug it is awful.,UNK

By accident I doubled dosed one evening - 40mg - and had the best sleep of my life. Woke up refreshed after eight hours of sleep and had great energy and alertness the entire day.

I get very terrible migraines with aura. I spoke to my doctor and she said she does not think these side effects could be due to the nexplanon. I have booked an appointment to have it removed anyway. I will see if this helps. The only good thing it does to me is it is effective in preventing pregnancies",UNK
2084,"I have suffered with chronic uticaria for over 10 years and over the last 6 months it has become a daily nightmare. Benadryl worked a bit but it was probably due to the sedating effect allowing me to sleep. However, I can now take 4 tablets and still itch. I&#039;ve combined this with an H2 blocker such as Zantac and it helps enough to be able to sleep a couple of hours and then I&#039;m awoken to intense itching.",UNK
2085,"I had this birth control inserted a little less than 2 years ago. I have experienced many, many symptoms with this method and kept waiting for them to go away but have yet to do so, so I&rsquo;m getting it removed next week. Experienced lots of hair loss (now have weird bangs from hair growing back), constantly on my period/spotting, although sometimes I get a month or 2 break (not worth 2 month long periods), and bad acne (never had acne before). Did not notice mood swings or change to my emotions (at least I don&rsquo;t think so). The one thing I do love about it is that it is good at preventing pregnancy and you never have to worry about taking anything.",UNK

I have been experiencing regular bleeding everyday since it was inserted, mild cramping about once a month and moodiness/depression.

I started at 40mg to help with my ADHD. I read lots of reviews how it makes you feel high and super active. I felt a little bit of a buzz but not high. It was just a pleasant feeling of happiness. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s different for everyone, but mine wasn&#039;t extreme. I also felt like I had more energy, but not enough to obsessively clean my house like others that left reviews.

2088,"If you&#039;ve ever wondered what it would feel like to straddle the gates of hell...this is the product for you! Not sure if its because of the strength one day dosage that makes it so painful, but it was the WORST. My package has the audacity to say that you can use it during the day or night...but make no mistake..if you use this during the day you will be completely debilitated. The first hour or so was no problem...then the burning started immediately. I wanted to remove my vagina from my body it was so bad. I ended trying to get it out after 2 days due to burning. There has got to be a better way. Why is Diflucan not an OTC drug?! It&#039;s ridiculous what we have to go through with having a vagina!",UNK
2089,It was fine for about 3 months...and then I started to notice that me and my Fience were fighting all the time. I would bite his head off if he said something smart or even if he didnt.

I was prescribed this BC to help regulate my hormone levels, my period, and the physical side effects of PCOS. I tried to remain hopeful while on this pill and stick it out for a full 3 months, but after just two full months, I was advised by my gyno &amp; family members/ friends to stop using it. This BC exacerbated my previously mild depression and anxiety to a level where I could not get out of bed or go outside. I would spend hours lying in bed and crying; I was so miserable. If you&#039;re someone who has even very mild depression/anxiety, I would recommend being HIGHLY cautious before starting",UNK

Tired of tons of prescriptions that didn&#039;t help me go and gave me have horrible symptoms, I ventured out on my own and drastically changed my diet but even that didn&#039;t work! Finally I tried Miralax because it was the only thing left and my doctor kept urging me to. I am so glad I did! I go two to three times a day and have normal stool. Sometimes my stool is on the runnier side or I get stomach cramps before a bowel movement but I am very happy with this product! It dissolves very well in any kind of drink. I recommend people to try it and give it about two weeks to work. Also, drink your water!",UNK
2092,"This type of BC is the most effective and hassle-free. When I first got it I was on my period for three months (this is different for everyone) I went back to the doctor and he gave me BC pills and my periods were normal from then on out. Some people are saying their hair is falling out and they are gaining weight, I have no signs of this. The only thing I don&#039;t like about it is I have to take the pills or my period will come and stay for a long time but that&#039;s better than being pregnant!",UNK

I emailed my doctor right away who suggested I give it some time for my body to adjust. Fast forward to almost a year of having it in now, the mood swings and depression are still there, just not as bad, not as much energy throughout the day and I get my period 2-3 times a month.

Keflex was well tolerated by me and helped to reduce the swelling within the gum until I was able to have a root canal retreatment in order to remove the rest of the nerve and pulp.

Then argue that I didn&#039;t say it, only to find out I did. Silly, but worth revisitng my physician about.  I struggle with the same 10-20 lbs but won&#039;t give up.

Not only did my sinuses feel good but I noticed that in general I felt amazing. My body just didn&#039;t hurt like it had been hurting for the past few months. So I got online and typed in Mucinex... low and behold the first thing that popped up was using mucinex as a treatment for fibromyalgia ... crazy.

2112,So far Zoloft has proven to be very helpful. I gave it the rating I did because it&#039;s only been two weeks on it. I have had 2 panic attacks today but so far so good. The Zoloft did keep them from going full blown. It&#039;s like I just all of a sudden began to calm down. I still feel a little anxious but I definitely have energy now. I started out on 25mg and then increased to 50mg the following week. I do have excessive yawning and some fatigue but overall this medicine is awesome. The doctors decided to try me on this because one day I just woke up and began to have panic attacks and they continually got worse. I was on Celexa 20mg which didn&#039;t help at all with anxiety. The reviews on this page definitely gives me hope to continue using  this.,UNK

Feeling flat and NO motivation to even brush my teeth. Went down to 25mg for a few days and now back to 50mg. On day 11 now and most of the depression has lifted. OCD isn&#039;t as bad, its more controllable, anxiety still there a bit. If this is the beginning of the future I&#039;m happy. It was worth the initial start!

But after taking this my acne is worse than it has ever been.  I&#039;ve been getting cystic acne all over my cheeks and chin.  And the worst part is that they severely scarred my skin and I never scarred before taking birth control.  I&#039;ve heard that in the first few months it can get worse before it gets better but I&#039;m on my 9th month and it just continues to get worse.  But I do like that it completely regulated my period to a 28 day cycle.  I&#039;ve decided to switch to a lower hormone birth control to see if that will help the acne subside.,UNK

Even when I increased the amount I was taking on my own, it never fully Took the pain away. He decided after a year or so, to put me on levorphanol and oxycodone for breakthrough pain. The levorphanol works​ ALOT better than the oxycontin still. Levorphanol must be sent through the mail to PA, as it&#039;s not carried in this state and MOST pharmacist have never heard of it.

I chose to use Abreva because it alleviates the pain, and is supposed to help with healing time. The Abreva in the US now comes in a pump form, and is much more liquid than the original. Abreva never cured my fever blisters in the 2.5 days they say it can, but it did used to help. This time, it exacerbated my blister, and it is HUGE! It has not spread like the other reviews have stated, but it&#039;s larger than normal, and I can only imagine that it&#039;s the Abreva I&#039;ve been using 5-8 times a day. Do not use this product. It either doesn&#039;t work, or it makes it worse. Both are bad scenarios. Use vanilla extract.",UNK

Dark urine and stool was about the only side effect I experienced except for dry mouth during the night. The key is to make sure you eat plenty before each dose. Do NOT eat or drink dairy while taking it. I made that mistake one time and that&#039;s all it took. Other than that I felt pretty good. I will also suggest a good brand of  probiotic to take daily as well. It was a tough ten days but I believe it&#039;s well worth it.,UNK

2183,Munik....thank you so much for your review.  I was telling a friend that I was feeling anxious and irritable today and wasn&#039;t sure if my new medication (Pristiq) was for me.  It&#039;s been 2 weeks and thanks to your words of encouragement I&#039;m hanging in there.

When I avoid Purell and isopropyl, I don&#039;t get those severe stomach pains.",UNK

It will help with the co-pay and usually takes up to $50.00 off of the cost of the medication. ,UNK
2188,"I was put on this this for Diabetic nerve pain.  The starting dose was 300mg twice a day. On the starting dose, I found I was slightly moody, had some stomach problems and the nerve pain was just as bad as ever, if not continuing to get worse. My Dr raised the dose to 600 twice a day and I became someone I did not even know. I was extremely moody, angry, difficult to be around. HORRID! It also effected my stomach more. I would eat, even just a small amount and have stomach pain, vomiting and so on. It got so bad I simply stopped eating. I simply lost the desire to eat, despite feeling hungry. Started having trouble with vision and intense headaches as well.

2189,This medication is great.  I&#039;ve tried several other antidepressants and this one is by far the most effective especially when taken concurrently with an SSRI.

But this side effect is insignificant in comparison to the benefits of taking the medicine.,UNK

I take it at night before bed with Lorazepam as needed, (I am probably going to switch to a more regular sleep med soon) and that pretty much solved the problem.

2200,I had severe pain in both shoulders for a couple of years and tried everything offered over the counter and some prescriptions that were mind benders to me. After surgery the pain was reduced from a 10 to a 5 which was almost tolerable. Ibuprofen caused constipation and aspirin caused stomach problems. A young female intern at the VA finally prescribed the Etodolac and now I live nearly pain free most of the time. Even the developed back pain that has developed over the years is more tolerable and I can live a normal life with little restraint.,UNK

I was switched to OxyContin and had started taking 20mg 3 X day.  Over 8 years, increased to 80mg X 2 day with OxyCodone for breakthrough.  Eventually I was up to 100mg X 2 day.

I have found that, while it does ultimately take care of the bronchitis, it takes at least 7-8 days from the time I start the medicine until I begin to feel relief. In fact, during this current episode, my symptoms continued to worsen until today, which is the day I took the last pill. I don&#039;t yet feel any better, but today I am not getting any worse.

I don&#039;t have PMDD or PCOS, my Doctor had me on Alesse because Tri Cyclen was causing me hives.  On the Alesse I realize I felt really anxious and didn&#039;t even consider it was the pill until I took Yaz.  Now I feel kind of relaxed and not concerned about everything being perfectly clean.

I have a feeling my copay will go from $30. to $50. but it&#039;s worth it to get results.

My period was pretty much non-existent, which was something I was looking for in a birth control. But, I gained so much weight (accumulating nearly 30 lbs). No matter what I did to lose weight- which I did through working out at least an hour six days a week and cutting my caloric intake to less 1,200 a day- it still did not work.

The bleeding stuck around through 2 months of pills and was accompanied by mood swings (which to be honest could have been due to the several month long period). Sure, it was effective birth control, but it&#039;s not hard to avoid pregnancy when an 8 month long period severely limits opportunities to actually get pregnant.

I&#039;ve been so dizzy and my stomach has hurt so bad I couldn&#039;t even get out of bed. As soon as I put it in I immediately felt different and in the most awful way. I just took it out and I&#039;m throwing the rest away. Like I said, never again. I&#039;ve heard some people have great experiences with it, but that certainly wasn&#039;t mine.

My physician then put me on Strattera. It is extremely expensive, since it is patented until May 2017, and I was given a sample 6-week starter titration pack (from 25mg to 80mg). I took a 25mg capsule last night around 7 PM, and an hour later, I was nauseous/lost my appetite, and I experienced sexual dysfunction (it took over an hour to reach a burning, painful orgasm).

2299,I took it yesterday after our little &quot;oops&quot; and had waited a little over 24 hrs before taking it. Woke up this morning with a terrible yeast infection. So far not all that great but I guess I&#039;ll figure out if it worked sooner rather than later.,UNK
2300,"Reload 20mg. Sometime the relief is 98% which is great. In other instances it works 70%.
The discomfort is better than the migraine: although I&#039;m afraid to tell my Dr because I&#039;m scared he will take it away and this is the best thing I&#039;ve had in a long long time.
Discomfort:
Tightness on the back of my neck, and shoulders, soreness inside my throat, mouth, face and around neck, as well as my legs and arms. Creating anxiety.",UNK

2304,"So far Alesse 28 has been a pretty good experience! I&#039;ve only been on it for over a month, but the good outweighs the bad! This is my first birth control I&#039;ve tried. I was very nervous this birth control would increase my breast size, just because I have naturally big boobs (38DD) and don&#039;t want them bigger. Haven&#039;t really noticed increase in breast size, maybe just made them a bit fuller. The first two weeks on the pill I started to break out which freaked me out because my skin was perfect pre-pill and I&#039;ve read reviews where it ruins some people&#039;s skin! Breakouts cleared by week 3. Only negative side effect I&#039;ve been noticing a lot is I&#039;m always hungry! Haven&#039;t gained weight because I eat pretty healthy and go to the gym regularly.",UNK
2305,"I had my period three times the first month, two on the second and two times again on the third. While this BC did not make me gain weight, I don&#039;t believe it helped with my acne much.

2307,"I have been on Effexor XR for approximately 7 years now. I was started off at 75mg and have since been raised to 225mg over the years. I have had good results on this medication. One downfall is the terrible withdrawals that I experience if I miss a dose. These effects happen within the first couple of hours of not taking it. Terrible headache, foggy feeling, and extreme eye sensitivity. Within a day of a skipped dose I become agitated, argumentative, and defiant. I do not look forward to switching from this medicine to a different one, which my doctor has suggested, due to the withdrawal symptoms.",UNK

Six months of treatment, and my acne was gone. I&#039;m 37 now, and have not experienced any long term side effects other than having my acne cured. I tried many medicines to treat the condition, but this one flat-out cured it. I would not have thought it possible.",UNK
2310,"I have been taking Saxenda for a week (.6 dose) and I am not hungry. The 3rd day I felt a bit tired but, by day 5 that was gone. I do not have the cravings that I had before starting the medicine. My doctor gave me a 6 week sample along with a prescription + discount card. I can tell by how loose my clothes are that I have lost some inches. I am excited!",UNK
2311,"I have been on Seasonique for two years now and I love it!! It took about two packs, or six months, for my body to adjust to the new period cycle, but it wasn&#039;t a problem at all. I was 16 when I started taking it, and was surprised in how quickly it worked especially with my ever changing hormones. Having a period four times a year is AMAZING, and I have absolutely no spotting in between. Plus, when I do have my period, it only lasts for four or five days, and the longer I have been on Seasonique, the lighter they have become. The only downside for me is that I get an achy back and back spasms during the time of the period, but they are not severe and end soon as my period ends. Highly recommend!",UNK
2312,I&#039;ve used the 3 day and the 7 day monistat. All with no problems. I&#039;ve used these products around 3-4 times before. When I would insert the cream it burned for no more than 20 minutes which was bearable. And today yet again I got another yeast infection and I wanted it gone as soon as possible so I got the 1 day monistat. INSTANT BURNING AND THE BURNING LINGERS. It didn&#039;t burn for 20 minutes. It&#039;s been about 3 hours since I put the medication in and it still burns. Is this what hell feels like? Don&#039;t feel comfortable enough to do anything. Is this a punishment for having premarital sex?? I don&#039;t know but I am definitely going to see a doctor next time. Yay I have a bad cold and also a burning and itching vagina to go with!,UNK

I asked my doctor to check testosterone level during my latest physical due to aging, gaining weight, lack of sex drive and basically feeling blah. They were indeed low so she put me onto this.",UNK
2314,Took this for 2 weeks and gained 2-3 pounds. I had been told to stay on it for a few months to detetmine its effectiveness. I discontinued it because of severe bladder spasms. Pain disappeared slowly over the next day.,UNK

I was sent to a different pain Dr and he started me on tramadol 50 mgs every 8 hrs. The worst medication I have ever taken! Not only does it not do anything for the pain it has made me feel ill. Severe headaches and just an all around feeling of being unwell.",UNK
2316,"This is honestly the worst birth control I&#039;ve ever been on. I&#039;ve been on several types and have never experienced acne like I did on Nora be. I stayed on it for 9 months, hoping it would get better but it didn&#039;t. It caused me to have painful cystic acne all over my face, the worst was by my mouth and chin. I had such bad cramps during my period that I was in tears. I just changed birth controls and these symptoms have gone away completely.

We started at 40 and that worked while I was taking my Zoloft at night, but when I moved it to the morning, we had to up the dose to 60mg. I have experienced nausea, dizziness, increasing perspiration, and a little insomnia, but they don&#039;t last too long. I have also been struggling with weight pretty much my whole life.

I had horrible cramps, sick to my stomach, and dizzy for a few hours after. the pill was making me sick and emotional  but not so far with skyla. The only negative things I experience now from skyla is horrible random cramps daily and I&#039;ve been spotting ever since.  But I&#039;m not pregnant still that&#039;s a plus.",UNK
2320,I would never recommend this birth control option ! I have been using it since January 2017 and till now which is March and I have had the worst emotional side affects severe depression and anxiety. I went to ER to get anxiety medicine to try to control this crazy mood changes. I immediately scheduled an appointment to get this removed . I haven&#039;t had an appetite and have felt like I couldn&#039;t work and focus because of the side affects. Please take this seriously I have lived the worst week of my life battling this thinking something was wrong . But looking at all the similar reviews I trust that it&#039;s this birth control .

My anxiety has spiked, I&#039;ve had multiple anxiety attacks since starting this pill (I am also on an anxiety medication and have been for a year and a half and it&#039;s helped with my anxiety levels wonderfully until I started Orsythia), I&#039;m almost at my breaking point with it. I&#039;m going to finish out this month and switch to something else. The only positive thing I can say about Orsythia is that it has prevented pregnancy. Would not recommend.",UNK

Unfortunately contracted another UTI this month, and took Nitrofurantoin again-- terrifying experience! After the second dose I developed long lasting chills, but my skin felt very hot. Painful cramping in my legs. Red rash all over my thighs. Migraine headache. Extreme fatigue, but could not fall asleep. The worst part was that I eventually could barely breathe, my heart was racing, and had to administer Epipen then head straight for ER. This medication works, but I unfortunately experienced severe side effects and therefore cannot recommend it.",UNK

It has made my face go from extremely red and filled with dots and bumps to smooth and almost regular skintone. I can finally go outside without makeup and not feel like an alien. Only side effect is that it makes my skin itch and burn a little after applying it. I solve this problem by using a moisturizer 5 minutes later. Oh, and one tube lasts forever!",UNK

I&#039;m a young healthy girl who eats healthy, is a healthy weight, and before my surgery worked out 4 X a week. I would have physically to force myself out of bed. And as far as the headaches it reduced the intensity of the migraines, but did nothing for the frequency. ",UNK

Within 2 month&#039;s I was back at my Doctors a mental mess and was put back on it. I guess you have to take the good with the bad. Does anyone else have a issue like this while taking this med?

I go to the gym, work with a personal trainer, and he says for my age, I am inn excellent shape. I play softball. I have no side effects of Eliquis so far.

With all powerful meds, however, come serious side effects. The worst is that it made me feel generally weird and depressed - I cringe when I think of putting a patch on. It gave me dry mouth and a bad after-taste. Lastly, it blurred my vision slightly. 

IF you time it right (put it on 4 hr before the heavy seas), you&#039;ll be seasick free. If you DON&#039;T time it right (such as you exceed the 4 hr window b/c the heavy seas don&#039;t come rt away), you&#039;ll still have positive results, though not as effective.

I got post birth control acne at its very worse!) anywho, I went back to the doc and she prescribed me prevefim....... I&#039;ve been on prevefim for a little under a year and I flipping hate it!!

I take thyroid medication (Oroxine) as well and I feel like Pristiq helps it to work better.  I have lost 10kg in four months without dieting and just a tad more exercise.  Less headaches, less backaches and aches and pains, a bit more get up and go which I need as I have 3 kids.  I&#039;m hoping that it doesn&#039;t wear off as some of the antidepressants have in the past.

2361,"I took clonazepam instead of xanax, but they are in the same family. I found it greatly helped my tinnitus. I was ready to lose my mind when I first got tinnitus from a virus in my inner ear 12 years ago. I swear clonazepam saved my life, as I was struggling with the idea of living with tinnitus forever. Anyone considering it should be aware that benzos are addictive and can have long-term negative side effects - I didn&#039;t realize it at the time. I&#039;m now tapering off clonazepam, as I hope to be able to handle the tinnitus with meditation, Effexor (anti-depressant and anti-anxiety drug) and a stubborn will. I do not regret using clonazepam for 12 years, but be aware going off it can be difficult. Most doctors aren&#039;t aware it helps tinnitus!",UNK

Now my anxiety is high because I can&#039;t sleep and when I do sleep it&#039;s because of xanax which makes me sleep for 12 hours and then I wake up late and I&#039;m unmotivated to do anything. Should I see my doctor for this?

2363,"I used Topiramate for 12 months for migraines which helped enormously, reduced them to 1 or 2 a month from the 10  .  Great side effect was the weight loss on 50mg, lost 60 lb but the migraines started getting worse so increased the dose to 100mg and had a LOT of side effects, periods stopped, body aches, palpitations, slow heartbeat, fatigue, memory loss the list was endless. I came off them altogether and migraines just came back as before and I put on 16lb weight in a month!  All the other side effects disappeared.  I have stayed off them for a month and am about to reintroduce them as I cannot stand the almost daily migraines.

Side effects for me have been extremely dry mouth, blurry vision, skin darkening on my face (cheeks) and memory/focus problems, some hair loss.

I want off of this as soon as possible due to the side effects but it has been very effective for the pain relief.

Also I am not sure but I have developed a swallowing problem which I never had and I know that if you have a swallowing problem before starting you should discuss with your doctor so I am just thinking that this has caused it.

I was even working out every day. The last day I took Lyrica (I only took it for one month), it made me so freaking miserable, I went home in tears.  My stomach swelled up like I was malnourished and every time I would bend over, I would throw up water or whatever I had just put on my stomach.  It was AWFUL!  In a month, I gained over 10 lbs.

  In my opinion the honest truth is this:  it can be a wonderful, miracle for severe depression and anxiety.  It can make a person more outgoing in their environment and provide someone with more energy.  

The only downfall I ever experienced with it was the withdrawal effects if I forgot a dose.  Brain zaps, nausea, general ill feeling.  If one takes it as directed, however, they shouldn&#039;t experience these.

2393,"My personal experience with suboxone is good so far. I have been on prescribed Fentanyl Patch 25 much/ 48 hrs. I have dropped to this dose over the last year. (I also left the old patch on). I have been on opiates for 12 years full time prescribed. At my highest prescription I was using 180mg of Oxycodone and 180 mg of morphine per day. I have had several adjustments on medicine including extended release doses. 5 years ago I was put on 50 mug of Fanta to with 3-10 mg Oxys per day for breakthrough. I started leaving my old patches on to increase my daily dose. This last year I tapered Down to 25 mcg patches for 48 hours.( still leaving my old patches on.) I went to a doctor that prescribes Suboxone. Lucky for me my insurance pays for Suboxone. He gave me the 8/2 mg strips. I take 1/2 a strip twice a day. I was checking every forum to see how long I needed to wait to start the suboxone. The replies are all very different. Some say 16 hours, most day 24. Others say 48-36-72 hours. Yikes! How do I keep out of precipitated withdrawals! I already have withdrawals every other day on my patch!... so I removed my patch last night around 5 pm. (I already have my suboxone script at home. ) so I started feeling withdrawal symptoms coming on around 11 pm. They didn&#039;t get super intense. I checked the cows scale as many articles suggested but only scored mild.. had the stretching of limbs symptom, anxiety.. so I took a half of a strip which was the suggested dose. I took it at 12 noon today. That&#039;s only 19-20 hours. I was in withdrawals, but not the worst I have ever had. I was scared of the precipitated withdrawals I heard about. 10-15 minutes after I took it, I felt a hot sensation wash over me. Thought I would get those withdrawals, but I took a quick bath, laid down for an hour and. Is I feel pretty good. Took my withdrawals away. I still have some muscle pain, but not the kind that come from withdrawals. Suboxone stopped the withdrawals right away. No headaches or sick feeling. Not high, but even my regular dose meds haven&#039;t made me high for years... so if your guessing on when it&#039;s ok to take suboxone after opiates, and fentanyl seems to be the highest strength, then I day shoot for 24 hours. If you are not in withdrawals at 24, then wait until you are.. if you are in withdrawals before 24 hours then just wait as long as you can. You will know when it&#039;s too bad to wait anymore. You know your body... you can always take half the amount prescribed and see how it reacts if your are afraid of precipitated withdrawals. Trust me, it will stop the withdrawals within a half hour. I have not gotten the precipices withdrawals so far. Hope this helps someone. Good luck to you!",UNK

Vyvanse does take care of his hyperactivity but, the lack of attention and defiance is still there.  Also, the medication takes 90 minutes to kick in.

I&#039;ve even developed blisters in my NOSE! and I have the red spots it&#039;s insane. No joke I seriously have about 80% of the listed side effects even the unreported and rare.

2419,I started taking this medication since I was 18 years old on and off. Let me put it in simple terms it is highly addictive. Yes it cured my anxiety but temporary only as long as I was on it. Miss a day and you want to crwal out of your own skin. The withdrawls are horrendous. Xanax just masks the problem. As soon as I got back on it my brain just wants it and thats all I think about. Valarian root is healthier and natural think twice before taking Xanax. Go for natural products if you can.,UNK

I still work out and am very active but it is a lot less extreme thanks to Seroquel.",UNK

I had maybe 2 or 3 days of spotting &amp; after that nothing!! I&#039;ve always had depression/anxiety so honestly can&#039;t say either way if this is normal. I have gained a significant amount of weight since, however my dr pointed out that I had been rapidly gaining weight before(thanks college!). I ALWAYS had perfect skin &amp; now I struggle badly w/ acne so this could have been a side effect. Just remember, every women is diff. discuss the decision throughly w/ ur Dr.",UNK
2423,Moved from levemir to basaglar as my insurance &quot;Discovery Medical Aid&quot; won&#039;t cover levemir. Been using basaglar for about 3 weeks now. It&#039;s been horrible so far. It appears to peak after 10 hours so that made it unpredictable given how they say it should work. I halved the dose to counter the hypo&#039;s but now sugars are higher than usual any other time. I feel out of focus and dizzy.  My chest feels &quot;fluish&quot;.  I am considering going back to levemir and paying the large copayment.,UNK

I&#039;ve been on disability since 2010 and been seeing a PM doc since about 2009 and in March he talked to me about trying an IR. I researched my insurance and when I saw him in April we decided on Exalgo 24mg per day with 15mg roxi backer. They seem to be working ok, but doc told me to take both 12mg caps in the am together which I did for about a week until I read here that others were taking them at 12 HR intervals  so I tried that and it seems as tho they are causing me to not sleep.

Already I&#039;ve seen significant changes in my blood sugars: 110-140 (fasting) and 85-170 (post meals). As a result, I&#039;m taking 1/2 the dosage of Levemir and less Novolog prior to meals.  I&#039;m hoping to come off insulin.  After starting Trulicity, I had some upper abdominal soreness and stomach cramping, but those symptoms have improved.  I have NOT had any diarrhea or nausea.  My appetite has decreased because I feel full all the time.  So far so good!",UNK

However, after I started panicking the very next morning (less than 24 hours) I went and bought the plan b pill from my local drug store for 50$. I did not feel anything after taking it but 24 hours afterwards I felt nauseous, and my stomach felt upset.

Well for this 3 days so far I have a lot of energy and my cravings for food have dropped. I work in a sit down job all day and sometimes were slow and so I eat all day to keep me from boredom. I been working out for 30 mins because I actually have the energy to do it and watch what I eat. It is great to eat small amount and feel satisfied I have not been able to do this since I was a teenager. I definitely have dry mouth all day so I carry water with me everywhere and a little jittery at times but I feel it is worth it. I will post back in a month  to report my success.,UNK
2438,"I bought this gel a few years ago and stopped using it as it wasn&#039;t that effective on my skin. However recently I started applying this along with a few other products and it was great. For me, I find it most effective when I apply it twice a day on the painful cystic pimple (normally on my nose). I wash the acne prone areas on my face with a wash that has salicylic acid 2%, then use a toner with witch hazel or a cotton pad soaked with pure green tea. I apply retinoid, let it sink in and then I apply Epiduo on those areas. I think it&#039;s important to use it as spot treatment if you&#039;re overly sensitive like me. If you&#039;re feeling dry I apply a cream with hydrocortisone over it at the end. My pimple bump disappeared in two days.",UNK

I developed  3 open, non-healing ulcers on my ankles that were so painful I had to go to the hospital. All the while my hematologist, my primary doctor and all the hospital doctors shook their heads and said they didn&#039;t know what was wrong.

My mood swings have diminished and my depressive episodes have nearly gone away. I have a couple of year now and they don&#039;t last nearly as long. I also don&#039;t get suicidal anymore. So much gratitude for this medication. I&#039;m on 100 mg right now and when I had my last depressive episode my doctor wanted me to increase my dose but it has a tendency to make me feel out of it and unable to experience any range of emotion really. I just try to make it through the depressive episodes instead.,UNK

It&#039;s just not worth it for those who have anxiety.",UNK
2447,I would not recommend this birth control to anyone. I just finished my second pack and ended up in the emergency room after bleeding for 8 days straight with the heaviest period of my life. I am used to heavy periods because I have endometriosis but this was the worst along with very painful cramps. I ended up with a huge cyst on my left ovary. Other side effects I have had are terrible anxiety and depression. The first month I was so sick to my stomach and could hardly eat. My breast have been swollen and so sore the last two months worse then both my pregnancies. The worst symptom is I have been so irritable and hateful which is not me at all. I just want to feel like myself again!,UNK

I noticed that I was much easier to get along with, periods were on a schedule, and my breasts appeared bigger! I didn&#039;t experience the weight gain or hardly any negative side effects. The most annoying thing was that the patch would sometimes fall off.

Fast forward to three months, I am bloated all the time and experienced a weight gain of about 15 pounds. I literally cannot stop crying and tend to bust out in tears at even a sad thought. The worst part is the mood swings. I finally decided enough was enough and threw them away. I will be requesting the birth control pill next time I am at the doctor.",UNK

After researching invokana and realizing how bad some of the side effects can be (kidney cancer or kidney failure), I asked Dr to take me off it, he did as long as I&#039;m keeping blood sugar down in normal range . It&#039;s been 3 months and so far I&#039;m controlling it with diet and exercise. I test my own blood sugar every day and its in normal range. I&#039;d rather do it this way as long as I can.

I have tried every pain medicine on the market and have to say fentanyl works the best. I no longer wake up from pain. It is in my opinion the best pain medication available on the market. I used to have to get it off the streets because no doctor believed I was in pain (I am in my 30&#039;s) now I finally found a doctor who prescribes it to me,  God bless him for it. I&#039;m using 50mcg every 48 hrs. I still get a little pain after any activity that stresses my back so might ask to try 75mcg but I am glad I have these patches.",UNK

I start to panic and lose my appetite, etc. I also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks.

It threw me into the worst withdrawals of my life. And I have had severe withdrawal in the past but this was so very intense unlike anything, for 2 days straight. The doc said it would be fine at 6 days but he was wrong, 15 min after injection I went into full fledge withdrawal, severe cramps, spasms, fever, vomiting, freezing yet burning up.

I continued to have cramps for nearly 2 weeks after it was inserted and I still have minor cramps occasionally though much more manageable.  I was spotting for nearly a month but it has stopped now.

The first day I didn&#039;t eat a thing.  It totally makes you not want to eat ANYTHING.  I actually had to force myself to eat a banana this morning and that&#039;s when I vomited.  I hope these side effects go away because I think this is the right medicine for weight loss. I&#039;m still taking Novalog once a day if my blood sugar is over 150.  Will update soon.,UNK

2482,I really hope this was going to work. My side affects were bad first a rash (very bad). Many creams and strong prescriptions we&#039;re given with little to no help but the worst was the heart damage. I had a mild heart attack the doctor felt strongly it was due to this medication this is only my experience I do not want to discourage anybody that it can help just be careful of all the signs,UNK

2484,"I was prescribed this pill to treat PMS however, taking this medication was the worst experience of my life. It alleviated anxiety but it made me severely depressed and paranoid. I am a fairly active person and I would go running every day. As soon as I began to take the pill I lost motivation to do the things I enjoyed and it got to the point where I did not even want to leave the house. I also almost lost my job over it. I tried to quit three times in one week and luckily my employer would not let me end my career and encouraged me to stay. 

Taking this medication also damaged my relationships with my friends and my partner and almost costed me my relationship. Please do not take this medication. ",UNK

This drug WAS NOT covered by my insurance but got the savings card to cut the costs down.  After a month of extreme constipation (even with taking laxatives), severe headaches and overall not feeling good I decided to quit taking this drug.

It is NOT a cure all for weight loss.   I do not eat that much so suppression of my appetite did not work, nor did it make me crave healthy foods like some have reported.   I was afraid to go to the maximum dosing of 2 and 2 but did it anyway.",UNK

I had taken lutera for three years for heavy and painful periods and then for the past 6 months had not gotten a period, which is common with PCOS. My doctor recommended I try zarah. Just in the first month, I was way more moody and retaining a lot of water weight. Then my periods came. It was the worst period I&#039;ve had since I started birth control. Painful cramps and heavy bleeding to the point I needed to change a super plus tampon every hour. I am going back to the doctor to get this changed, since I waited the three months to see if anything would change. The only positive was that it was an effective birth control.",UNK
2488,I have used Tramadol for over 5 years. I am on a 200mg slow release tablet of which I take 3-5 a day. They say that it decreases the heart rate but it seems to me that last night when I checked my heart was doing 190/min....so that blows that theory out of the water. I can tell that it does make you restless and at times reckless and also increase your anger responses. Hope this helps.,UNK
2489,I just started today and wasn&#039;t expecting to see any difference as most antidepressant take weeks to see any difference. Today about 2 hrs after taking I felt so tired. Being at work didn&#039;t help. I have read many of the other comments and am hoping it&#039;s a miracle drug like a lot have said. I take Seroquel for sleeping that I think will help as a lot of others say Pristiq interferes with sleeping.

If I take it on an empty stomach I am ok. But if I eat with in 5 hours of taking it I become dizzy and feel drunk. Because of my family and work obligations some times I have to skip a dose so I can function properly. Also I have trouble with my memory. I am a huge trivia buff but right now it is hard for me to remember anything, I have not put on much weight but it does seem that after I take a dose and eat then I am hungry and can not get full.

It does NOT sick to the inside of your cheek, as everytime you swallow it moves around and either sticks to your teeth or you swallow it. Horrible, horrible medication. Films often crack in half by the time you can finally pry them out of the foil and they are so small that if you have an sort of tremor, as I do, they often fall out of my fingers. IMO, they need to scrap the whole thing and start over. Horrible.",UNK

My OB inserted Skyla the 23rd of April, the pain was bad. I took a 800mg pain pill, but it still hurt. It hurt after, but I took a hot bath to help my body relax, which helped the cramps. I started bleeding the Thursday after I got it inserted and I&#039;m going on seven weeks of it. I just had a check up, so she could look at the strings and she said that I have 3-6 months of possible bleeding. I do have to say though, that this bleeding is heavy, but no where near as hard as I was before. So I guess that&#039;s good. Hoping the bleeding stops soon.",UNK

The first 3 days, my sex drive was through the roof, mood swings gone but bloating instantly but then 5 days - a week later, bloating, depressed, angry mood swings, acne has gotten 10x worse especially on my back, weight/water gain, and now a week and half later I have cramps randomly. I also have been eating like crazy and crazy food at night and junk food. So basically its like I&#039;m on my period!

I can&#039;t believe it would make me suicidal but yes...it does.  I stopped taking it because I couldn&#039;t stand the spotting...well of course that turned into a heavy period. Then 2 weeks later I got another full period. So I went without birth control for another month which wasn&#039;t cool. So I decided at the start of my current period I would start back taking it.

My Dr said my cervix was to &quot;the side&quot; and had to use an instrument to &quot;hold it tight and in place&quot; it took her 10 mins or so messing with my cervix to finally get the Kyleena in.  Despite of taking Hydrocodone 30 mins prior, it still hurt.  I sat for 5 mins after insertion and was dizzy/nauseous walking out.  I bleed a little heavy for the next hour or so, but then it stopped.  I feel cramps and discomfort down there as if I had &quot;something&quot; stuck inside, it may be due to my cervix being &quot;messed&quot; with.  I have very minimal spotting but only when I wipe.

I started getting side effects the last 2 months since the doctor gave me Solodyn 55. Now I have problems breathing and a little dizzy. I am only 30 and very healthy and this is the only pill I take so I think it had to be the upgrade on mg that is causing my new problems. I stopped the pills but am still using the cream. Hopefully I wont get the acne back. I would recommend this but make sure you pay attention to any changes in your health and stop taking it then.,UNK

Since then, Skyla has been pretty good. The only time I notice Skyla is during my period. My bleeding is light, but WOW do I get horrible cramps. I rarely got cramps prior to using Skyla, and these feel similar to the ones I had post-insertion. However my friends have not had this issue &ndash; every body is different.

Days 3- 4 went down hill fast. by day 5 I was staying within 5 feet of the bathroom. I didn&#039;t realize one of the side effects was dizziness (since I have vertigo I figured my allergies were acting up), weakness &amp; major gas.

My eating/fitness habits have not changed one bit since I got the implanon inserted, so it is quite obviously due to the implanon which seems to be a common complaint.

My love interest is better although I still rely on the Cialis, but now I have total control of my orgasm.

It was so nice not having a period at all so I decided to stay on it. And with that I gained 15 pounds( did not change diet or stop exercising) I work out 5-6 times a week and eat a very clean diet.

I experienced absolutely no weight change and my periods almost and when I did get my period they were painful, but they were so infrequent so it wasn&#039;t a concern. I noticed also that my acne got worse.

PROS:
-you can forget about it

-It was MUCH cheaper than anything else. I just had to pay my deductible.
CONS:
-I&#039;ve had my period for what feels like forever. In the beginning, it was just slightly longer than my normal period and slowly increased to where I&#039;m lucky to have 3 days without it in 3 months
-I&#039;ve had minor hair thinning, nothing noticeable to others
-I feel more depressed

After one month of being on it using one puff in the morning and one before bed I noticed a rash on my chest only and white spots on my tongue. I also noticed that when I was speaking that my voice would get deep and soon change back to normal. I started to go to a new doctor and was given antibiotics for the tongue yeast infection. I also had blood work done and was told that my vitamin D bone density levels were low so I now take vitamin D to take up for it. My chest rash got so bad that I had to stop the Qvar. I see a new doctor tomorrow but the two I saw after being put on Qvar could not figure out why my rash was so bad.,UNK

For those who are scared, the injection does not hurt. You can opt to have an anesthetic anyway. Although I no longer suffer from the horrific pains, constipation and vomiting associated with my periods, I do still experience bleeding after my injection along with cramping which as far as I know is not normal considering the aim of Zoladex is to effectively induce a medical menopause.

Mostly because of the pain that I felt from the IUD is giving me PTSD, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel as comfortable anymore. The strings did scare him when he felt them the first time, but he fine afterwards. I did not have a numbing shot, prior to insertion, also. It&rsquo;s around the time to start my period and I&rsquo;m bleeding heavily now. But it also comes and goes. Having an IUD at the age of 20 is such a weird thing.",UNK

2841,Today (6/21/17) I went into planned parenthood where I scheduled a change in birth control. From the depo shot to mirena. The depo shot has so many side effects that I had been dealing with for 3+ years now so I was ready for a change. I go in expecting to get mirena when the Dr tells me they don&#039;t carry it anymore but that Liletta was pretty much the exact same. Another option was I believe Skyla. I haven&#039;t had a period in 3 years being on the depo shot and wanted to keep it that way which was why I wanted mirena. Many women end up not having one at all. She told me skyla I would have a period for sure but Liletta there was a possiblility I wouldn&#039;t. Getting it inserted was the worst pain I&#039;ve ever endured in my life. Honestly.,UNK
2842,A few months ago I shared my horrid experience about this drug. This drug increased my bleeding 10 folds and continued for 4 months of very heavy bleeding. I went to a specialist and he said I should have never been prescribed depo and the effects irreversible and they stay in your body more than 8-10 months and there is nothing that can be done. You can only imagine my despair. I did however manage to get in and see another doctor. This doctor is my miracle. She prescribed me yaz drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol tablets. The first 2 days the bleeding increased tremendously but after that it COMPLETELY STOPPED. To me this was a miracle. I am sharing this hoping that it could bring women in my condition some relief. .,UNK

I tried it for four nights and, after about 4 or less hours of sleep each night, I reduced the dose to 20mg.  I noticed my neck pain decreased at the 30mg but I can&#039;t function without any sleep.  I have had two migraines while on the 10 and 20mg doses of this medication.

After having the same problem I decided to try dulcolax again, having it been successful the last time. WORST DECISION EVER. Not only did it take almost 16 hours to start working, it came with severe nausea and cramps before any success. It&#039;s been a day and I still can barely eat without experiencing serious diarrhea!

The only bad side effect I have had is higher body temperature and sweating.  I am currently researching other medications just because of this side effect.

Also, OTC  product called Luvena (Restorative Vaginal Moisturizer, pH balanced) is super effective and doesn&#039;t cause the stinging and break through bleeding of Estrace. Luvena is significantly cheaper than insanely over priced Estrace ($300 or a $72 co-pay). Really, Estrace should cost about $15 and not the criminally high price it is

The appetite suppressing effect made it easier for me to modify portions and lose the weight I&#039;d gained. I took Cymbalta for two years.

Now, there are two small flaws to this product:

1. As some others had mentioned, Drysol can be a little irritating to the skin. The applied area might sting a little or be itchy, but it&#039;s nothing terrible.

2. Because Drysol is essentially closing the pores in your armpits to achieve results, this does lead to more sweating in some areas, if you have heavy forehead/back sweat.",UNK

My emotions were up and down horrible mood swings and depression as well. I would have no cramping barely any bleeding which was great since I was used to such bad cramping and heavy periods.

Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t make the connection between my ailments (extreme fatigue, anxiety, depression, digestive problems,  just to name a few) and the IUD until many years after insertion. After spending a fortune on doctors, tests, etc  to find out what was wrong, I still had no answers, except to be put on a variety of medications to treat symptoms. I did some research and finally made the connection-copper toxicity from the ParaGard IUD. Years of my life had been sucked away from me and my family  that I can never get back. Symptoms still persist a year post removal.",UNK

That&#039;s too much for me.  This drug has been around for a long time, there&#039;s no sense it delaying medical care like this.    So how about that?  Automatic preauthorization should be just as dangerous and just as denounced.  For CFS this drug can be life or death for people.  I wish it wasn&#039;t an allergy for me though. :(",UNK

The nausea, I use peppermint or gum to overcome. Constipation and dry mouth, I drink more water.  I do get a jittery feeling but it does  go away.  No issues with sleep. Take B12 pills for energy.

I usually always remembered but was sometimes a hassle to remember every day. I had good and bad side effects. It got rid of all of my acne and made my periods regular. I did gain about 25 pounds and had a much lower sex drive though. I did spot occasionally but not too often. If I decided to take the pill through my period rather than stopping, sex would start to hurt deep in my uterus eventually. That happened many times. I decided to get off that birth control a few months ago and I could tell that I had a complete change in my body. I lost weight and felt happier. My sex drive went up incredibly.",UNK

Secondly, normal opiate withdrawls (PAWS) is only 3 to 7 days (I&#039;ve never had more than 4), medicine like oxycodone has a SUPER SHORT half life and is out of your body quickly. The issue is that you brain needs time to rebalance itself so you become hypersensitive with the flood of chemicals as they try to even out. Suboxone has a 36hr half life give or take so a day after you take it plus some added time, its still in your system. Suboxone should be taken for 4 or 5 days tops, that will have it in your system up to the 7 day point. Thats all you need.",UNK

I talked to my dermatologist and she prescribed me a coated tablet, which was significantly easier to digest. Down side: the coated tablet was much more expensive, even with good insurance. With the coated tablet, I notice no negative side-effects. This medication works fast.

My grades have improved in school, my mood is slightly elevated and my cavings for sugar have ceased. It has not affected my sleep and so far works great.

It&#039;s ridiculous they keep lowering the amount their &quot;savings&quot; plan covers. For this reason I will be switching to something else. I have several friends &amp; acquaintances that also use Contrave (some at my recommendation) and their costs also went drastically up.

I have been only taking 100-150 mg. I break to be 100 mg pill in half and take 50 mg every six hours. My blood pressure went from 197/130 to approx 147/97.

3078,"This antibiotic is brutal, but does its job.  I began it 3 days ago due to pericoronitis (infection at rear of wisdom tooth).  By the 3rd dose, the infection was basically gone.  It worked so quickly that I questioned if my body had killed off the bacteria, or if the antibiotic was really that powerful.

It&#039;s really that powerful.

Sadly, the side-effects are quite unpleasant, but an indicator that they are really working.  Fatigue, mild nausea, and lower abdominal issues seem to be quite common, and all three have hit me.  It&#039;s unpleasant to the point that I&#039;ve more than once thought of stopping the treatment, but I know that&#039;s a bad idea.

It works really well...I just hope that I don&#039;t have to take it again for a very long time.",UNK

I laid there for about 25 mins feeling sick and having terrible cramping. Soon after I was fine! Mild cramping for the first few days and then for the next week (lessened over time). I bled for about three weeks after insertion- different everyday. Sometimes more than others. Just had my first cycle while on Skyla. Very light, but lasting about 7 days. had a few breakouts but may be stress related too. Feeling great so far!",UNK

Secondly, I noticed my face breaking out along the jaw line. This has been a problematic area for me before but never quite this severe. I get once a week facials and there was absolutely no explanation for this.

The downside (for the patient) is the taste, which is an absolutely appaling, cherry cough syrup, saltwater horror show. I&#039;m honestly amazed I didn&#039;t vomit.

The dr told me after 9 months of it being in the bleeding should stop, but it hasn&#039;t. I still get cramps and I gained 20 lbs. My skin is extra sensitive to the sun so I burn all the time. My moods are better, my acne comes and goes. My sex life isn&#039;t at its full potential because I don&#039;t want to have sex if I&#039;m spotting... Which is all the time. I haven&#039;t gotten pregnant so this thing works, so I&#039;m reluctant to try something else and put my body through another traumatic time. For now I&#039;ll deal with the spotting.

It worked immediately and I felt it had no side effects besides helping me sleep most nights uninterrupted. After taking the medicines for 8 months I began feeling lightheaded and got blood pressure in the neighborhood of 90/50 so I stopped use with support from my doctor. I&#039;ve been getting healthy readings since . However, at my doctor&#039;s visit I realized I&#039;d gained a pound a month since starting Bystolic. I  first quit cold turkey, on my own- bad idea- I experienced mild vertigo and the &quot;heavy leg&quot; feeling some people have reported (which I also felt on the drug). Now it&#039;s out of my system and I feel great- much more alert, energized, and losing weight much more easily.",UNK

The problem for me is getting used to the medication so I start on 10mg for a week then slowly increase the dose to 20mg. For a few weeks though I&#039;m more anxious and at times suicidal and depressed so I take Valium while that&#039;s happening.

Over the years I&#039;ve tried: Detrol LA (rubbish), Ditropan XL (not effective), Vesicare (blurry vision), Enablex (worked for a while but still not enough control), and now I am on Toviaz 8mg. So far Toviaz is the most effective of those. It really cuts down on frequency. I only get up once in the night and can go 3-4 hrs without urinating (daytime). The incontinence is much better. My problem is my brain sees the toilet and doesn&#039;t want hold off until I can get my belt and jeans down, and my ass on the throne. My insurance won&#039;t cover it now so will switch again.",UNK

After one week, I noticed the sluggishness when forming a thought, the forgetting things moments after the thought entered my brain, and tingling in my face.  I also had some issues sleeping.

Talked with my doc and she confirmed all of this was normal due to the Topamax, and it was up to me to continue.  I had already purchased the month dose at the time I got my free dose, so I decided to stick it out and try it.  The FIRST day of the doubled dose was absolutely awful.  I felt anxious and my face was numb and tingly from 6am to 6pm, no exaggeration.  I immediately stopped. Lost 12lbs but not worth it.",UNK

Found out later that he was overmedicated. What I didn&#039;t like about Focalin was that he became very quiet almost Zombie like. Also, the medication did not last in his system long enough. He stopped takes Focalin XR over a year now and has been on Vyvanse (70mg.) I am considering putting him back on Focalin with a lower dose.",UNK

Procedure was 1 whole minute probably. 3 weeks later I went to the ER because I couldn&#039;t stand the pain and I knew something was wrong, found out I had an STI and it was a STI that the doctors were supposed to test for before putting in the IUD. Long story short, once all those were cleared up, the pain was fine. To this day I still have a bit of cramps often but nothing too bad and my periods are much lighter.

Which I thought Ocella was always compared to BeYaz. So let me just say it did wonders for my skin. HOWEVER, within a week of taking the pill, I noticed a huge change in my mood. I was really sad all of the time, especially at work. It only went down from there.

I had terrible mood swings to the point people were referring me to other brands. My period was extremely light as if I barely even had it at all, which made me worried sometimes.

I bled nonstop for the whole three months, and my gyno told me that the bleeding wouldn&#039;t stop anytime soon, even if I switch birth control. I&#039;ve read that the bleeding is caused by the progesterone only in the shot, so some women need an estrogen supplement or a different method of birth control that contains estrogen (I&#039;m on the patch now) to counteract the bleeding.

I didn&#039;t have trouble sleeping, but I gained 10 lbs every 6 months.  I have had a lot of stress in my life and the Lexapro wasn&#039;t enough for me and had to take Xanax on occasions.

3191,"Just turned 40.  Periods have been extremely heavy w/ clots galore and horrible cramps since high school. I&#039;ve tried 4 different types of birth control pills, tried the depo shot, and tried Mirena; nothing worked. I feel like when studies say &quot;9 out of 10 people&quot; that I&#039;m always the one person it didn&#039;t work for, whatever &quot;it&quot; may be. Doc said to try tranexamic acid first and if it doesn&#039;t work, to consider an ablation before considering a hysterectomy. I&#039;ll try to rate this on a pros and cons scale. PROS: My period got slightly less heavier midway thru the second day, but not light by any means. CONS: extreme dizziness, numbness in face and hands, severe sharp pains in my abdomen. Not willing to do this monthly. Guess ablation&#039;s next. :(",UNK
3192,"There are various manufacturer of clonazepam. I always made sure to stay with the same manufacturer. However, a week into taking the pills from my new prescription I started to feel very ill. I still had several pills from my previous refill because I only required  1/2 of the 0.5 mg. It was prescribed for me for chronic neck pain. The manufacturer changed the ingredients and now I have been suffering for months to find a replacement to no avail. It&#039;s been working well for years but right now the horrible effects I&#039;m getting I don&#039;t think I&#039;d recommended to any one. Please try every option before having to suffer the consequences in the long run.",UNK

After taking the second pill, my whole body started aching, hot flashes, fever, everything. It was so bad that I wasn&#039;t about to take care of my child. My husband tried to help but there was nothing he could do. I stayed up until 4 am because of the tossing and turning to get comfortable. This medicine needs to go.",UNK
3194,"I got Skyla inserted March 15th, which was the 5th day of my period. It was suggested I get it inserted while on my cycle due to the fact that I&#039;ve never had children and during your cycle your cervix is supposed to open up some. Insertion hurt like hell I groaned in pain that was the absolute worst pain I&#039;ve experienced (I&#039;ve had my nipples pierced and a foot tattoo which are pretty painful but the insertion tops that!), I got so hot afterwards and light headed I had to sit there for a minute while the nurse got me water. Haven&#039;t had any side effects besides constant spotting like I haven&#039;t stopped bleeding since the insertion, its March 25th so I&#039;ve had additional bleeding for a week and half going on two weeks.

I breastfeed my son so taking all that medicine wasn&#039;t an option for me. I&#039;ve had a period for 5 months straight. No breaks no nothing. It&#039;s a great form of birth control because no sane man wants to have sex when you&#039;re bleeding all over the place. I&#039;ve been hormonal and having emotions all over the place. I&#039;m literally a ticking time bomb. Great mood when you&#039;re a mom of a toddler. I seriously can&#039;t wait to get this thing out!!,UNK

I am a zombie-I have no motivation to do anything and I&#039;m always in a foggy state. My performance at work has greatly suffered, along with my cognitive ability. Social anxiety has gotten worse only because I&#039;m a recluse - just too tired and unmotivated to interact with people! Frequent and strong anhedonia. I wouldn&#039;t advise you not to try lexapro- it is well regarded and often effective. But be cautious as doctors don&#039;t get that there are side effects to this besides sexual ones. I felt the same after one week as I do now but I was continually told it would go away",UNK
3197,"I had my Mirena implanted on April 12th of this month. The exam was uncomfortable, the measuring part was a little painful and the actual implant was the easiest. Didn&#039;t even feel it! I had to ask was it in. Cramped a little that night and went to work the next morning.
Noticed some spotting with more cramping. Nothing that stopped or slowed me down at work though. However after about 48 hours of having the implant I began to feel nauseous. And the following day I felt mean one minute, and normal the next. Mood swings!
Ok so I can deal with all of that. But I noticed my stomach began to bulge out of nowhere. I mean my son is 7 months old and I&#039;d did pretty good with losing my baby weight. Now I look pregnant! ",UNK

However this subsided within the first six months. Otherwise I had a relatively good experience, and my periods became so light that they almost stopped. However I was not doing well remembering to take the pills and recently switched to Mirena. Tricyclen is a great option if you are able to remember the pills on time!",UNK

However, it did not help with my social anxiety whatsoever. Going out of the house has become a difficult task along with trying to converse with others as I become extremely uncomfortable and anxious. But, this medication greatly helped turn my mood and thinking around 180 degrees. The side effects have brought me to the point where I just cannot take it anymore. I will sleep 10+ hours and still feel exhausted, struggling to open my eyes. As mentioned, my mood is great now but I feel like I have less motivation to do anything and less emotion altogether. Did not work best for me.",UNK

Depression came back and I had unpleasant side effects with the oxcarbazapine. My doc added modafanil. It reduced the side effects and improved my depression. It also caused irritability. And caffeine made me restless even with a small amount.,UNK

I was hospitalized years ago with a ruptured disc and was given Flexeril 3 times a day. I was so out of it that I could hardly stay awake and it took about a week to get back to normal after I was released. However now that I have had spinal fusion at C4-5 the Flexeril is not really effective relaxing my very hard muscle spasms. I have had 3 surgeries, 2 of them failed. The second was anterior (back of the neck) and cut through the nerves and muscles in my neck. The result is chronic muscle spasms in my neck and generally my left shoulder area.

I&#039;ve tried a lot of medications and it seemed a short course of antibiotics or birth control were the only things that seemed to help. In October 2014 it got very inflamed and painful so I saw a dermatologist.  She put me on Solodyn (antibiotic) for 3 months only and then Ziana gel. I will be honest, Ziana definitely makes your skin worse before it starts to make it better. The drying I experienced was minimal but it truly made my skin &#039;purge&#039; like I had read it would. It got so bad and red that I wanted to cry and curse Ziana, however, after about 2.5 months it started to get better with no more breakouts. Just be patient!!",UNK

I started out on the 10mg patch.  The biggest issue with it was weight loss.  Now, let me begin by saying that before the appointment where I was diagnosed, I had just eaten lunch.  Shortly after starting Daytrana, I caught a cold that lasted about two weeks, recovered, then caught another two-week cold.  I did notice that I was less hungry while using the patch.  Didn&#039;t eat breakfast before my checkup,  My weight went from 120 to 114 lbs.  Doctor took me off Daytrana and switched me to Stratera, which has been a nightmare.

I decided to discontinue this because the cramping I have is becoming unbearable. I have cramping 3 out of 4 weeks and I have to take 4x 800mg ibuprofen.

As of Feb 2012 I have not had a seizure since but I have found this medicine makes me very tired and I itch all over all the time. I was taking 500mg in the morning and 500 in the evening. Then we changed it to 1000mg in the evening and none in the morning. I find it very hard to get motivated in the mornings. I want to stay in bed and sleep. I take antidepressants but I&#039;m not depressed or crying. I had been and they felt under the circumstances I need to stay on the antidpressant.

No dizziness, no diarrhea. During these 5 hours, I also drank much water to help the situation. In the past 6 days I almost didn&#039;t have meals for the 3 days, (I was sad for being fired). I guess this is psychological. I read many panic comments by other people, saying about strong pain, cold sweats, diarrhea, dizziness, and feeling near to pass out.

Weeks 4-5: very small old blood spotting.  One panty liner a day is all I needed.
Weeks 6: mix of old blood and fresh blood.  no  cramps.
Weeks 7-8: Heavy flow with very intense cramps.  This is where I am currently at and I am not sure if I want to continue this medication.

I attempted suicide a few weeks after starting it, because I was still depressed but was more numbed to the guilt I would usually feel. Be careful of this, make sure someone is aware if you feel at risk. It took a few months, but I began to feel positive things again, but eventually I was stuck in a zombie state where the side effects outweighed the good. I tried it on a few occasions with the same result: taking myself off them because I wanted to feel again. The best advice I can give is to see a psychiatrist, not a GP.

I am unable to lose it despite having consistently worked out for 4-5 days a week with a personal trainer.

So total I ended up bleeding for about 6 weeks straight through each pack of pills.  I&#039;ve been on it for about 9 months now and this has happened every time. I will definitely be changing to another kind. I&#039;d rather bleed once a month heavily than 6 weeks straight. I also was extremely tired all the time.

In the big picture I like the pill. My sex drive is the same. Not any more or less moody than I have been and no headaches or pains.,UNK
3242,"Started trulicity about 8 months ago at .75mg...in the beginning very queasy &amp; complete loss of appetite which was a great thing. Also belching &amp; heartburn/sour stomach. I noticed after about 3 months the effects wore off so my doctor put me on 1.5mg 1x per week plus the .75mg 1x per week. None of the side effects returned...my appetite is back, no queasiness, weight loss stopped as well as no more sour stomach or belching. Wonder if anyone else has experienced the effects of the medicine wearing off as well. Not sure why I am still on it at this point! Also taking 1000mg Metformin 2x daily &amp; invokanna.",UNK
3243,"I was prescribed Protopic for atopic dermatitis on my eyelids, which had been kicking around my eyelids for about 4 months, really irritating. The first application definitely was on the hot/burning side for about 12 hours, the second and third applications were not. The Atopic dermatitis appears to be improving. Also, I do not know if it was coincidental, but I woke up at 4AM with a heavy migraine and then got sick, that may have been from the meal I ate at 9PM, some sort of food poisoning, because I had gas all day long and the food did all come up. Don&#039;t know, but I am fine 24 hours later.",UNK

However, like many other reviewers on here..the nonstop, irregular bleeding is horrendously affecting my life. I&#039;ve never felt so trapped.  I am constantly paranoid whenever I go out, always asking a close friend or family member I&#039;m out with to check to see if I&#039;m leaking through my pants, I&#039;m over it. I want to get it removed but the convenience of it is partially the reason why I also want to keep the implant in. My doctor prescribed Loestrin to counteract the irregular bleeding and while it helped (a lot), the minute I stopped taking the pills, the bleeding became irregular once again.",UNK

It was the worst day ever. I am now only taking half a tablet to wean myself off this drug. Had I known these severe side effects after wanting to stop them, I never would have started them. Since halving my dosage, I have been having anxiety, joint pain, itching, and swelling in my sinuses. I am hoping to be off of these within 2 weeks since I only took them for around two months",UNK

What I have experienced in my first week is tiredness, irritability/difficult sleeping, grinding teeth, nausea (vomited 5 times on night 1, which settled on second day), loss of appetite and general stiffness around my neck and back. 

I trust these symptoms will settle in the coming weeks but thought it may be valuable to share my first week, for those who are a little sensitive to medication.

I stopped by the fifth pack because I simply couldn&#039;t take it anymore. Migraine was so severe and depression and anxiety made me feel restless. I bled again. The smell of my discharge is not really good like there was something rotten (I don&#039;t use tampon). I gained weight too. Though I have lesser acne.

I couldn&#039;t stand the person next to me, any person who made a noise or laughed too hard. I was very mean and so frustrated towards everything my boyfriend did and said and the next day I would feel bad and apologize. this pill made me feel like a crazy person and was driving me insane.

I don&#039;t blame it entirely on this medicine, it MAY have been the combination of this and Astepro; but in my experience this definitely causes drowsiness.

The first two weeks I ended up restless and could not sleep, I was also shivering and tense during the day. I was then prescribed Lexapro, which helped me get back to my normal sleeping schedule. It did help with my anxiety more, but it did not do much for my depression. My constant hopelessness went away, but I didn&#039;t really find the will to commit to goals, motivate myself, and just become more content. I&#039;m really just feeling like I&#039;m in the middle.

My husband even says &quot;it must be blue pill week!&quot; since this is the week I tend to be extremely moody. I used to be really nice and laugh at just about anything but now while on this pill I just feel super anxious and I even think this raises my blood pressure.

For the 6 months I&#039;ve had the nexplanon I bled for 4 out of those 6 months straight. and when I wasn&#039;t bleeding constantly, I would randomly bleed so I constantly had to have a pad for tampon in for 6 months straight.

3296,"Started taking this pill yesterday (11/19/17) and about 2 hours after taking it felt extremely nauseous and tired. Came home and took a nap. Felt better when I woke up. Definitely noticed a difference in appetite. Wasn&#039;t hungry for anything. In the evening, I did recognize the cravings were coming back, but I steered clear of sweets. Woke up today with a horrible headache, not sure if it&#039;s related or not, but leery to take contrave again today because of headache. Will update later. But so far it is reducing cravings and can tell when it wears off. I&#039;m sure when I ramp up to pills in afternoon, it won&#039;t wear off.",UNK
3297,I just started this medication..75 dose. I&#039;m worried about the lab tests on rats causing thyroid tumors...anyone else know about this?,UNK
3298,I am 21 and I had my Mirena inserted in March of this year. I had heard a lot of scary stories and people telling me not to get it. I continued anyway and had it put it. I had it inserted 4 months after my daughter was born. I personally think that having the Mirena put in was worse than child birth. I cramped for a couple of days and then it didn&#039;t hurt anymore. My doctor told me that my period may completely go away but she said most likely it would just slow way down. The reason I don&#039;t like it is because the removal strings feel like fishing line and haven&#039;t softened like my doctor said they would. It hurts during sex. Plus I have NO sex drive whatsoever. I just don&#039;t like it.,UNK
3299,"I loved the shot as far as having no periods at all! But that was the only good thing about it. My hair fell out like crazy, lots of hair loss while brushing my hair, shampooing and just touching it. And it didnt stop. I have only had one shot which lasted for the 3 months and since day one of the shot my hair has fallen out. It used to be so thick, now my hair is thin. Not only hair loss, I had terrible terrible mood swings. Mad for no reason all the time. I have spoken to other people that took this and they said the hair loss never gets better, only worse. I did not gain weight, I was hoping to as I weigh 112, but I did not gain in 3 months time.  I am not going back for my second shot, the hair loss and mood swings is not worth it.",UNK
3300,"My brother took this and felt very anxious, my only side effect is feeling super tired and kind of out of it.  It really helped my cough and I think it is starting to help with my chronic sinus infection.  I am allergic to Levaquin so I was nervous taking it since it is in the same drug family.  I did not have the same reactions that I had when I was taking Levaquin.  I have had 5 sinus infections in the past 6 months and the Z-pac has quit working....so overall things are getting better.",UNK

I feel like I&#039;m in withdrawal most of the day it has some good effects it dissolves quicker and not as constipated but as far as being better than subs no way I feel like I&#039;m constantly craving one all day almost and if u don&#039;t take it the same time everyday your sick as hell till u do....,UNK
3304,"Doc put me on Metformin, which my liver didn&#039;t fair well with, and then tried the Januvia 100mg.  After 2.5 wks, I told him I was experiencing facial / hand / eye lid swelling and told him I felt this wasn&#039;t a good fit for me.  So, he prescribed Januvia 50mg, which after three days, caused nausea, upper abdominal pain, orange urine, and skyrocketing BG from low 120&#039;s to well over 200&#039;s after eating.  I immediately quit taking it.",UNK
3305,"I&#039;ve been on Synthroid (Levothyroxine) for about a year and a half now. They&#039;ve changed my dose 4 times so far and I&#039;m currently at 100 mcg.  Once they keep me on a dose for a bit, I feel okay, but with every change I have a few annoying side effects.  I can say that if you take it every day like you&#039;re supposed to, it will work eventually. You have to be patient, it won&#039;t make you feel great right away. It took me about 3 months.  But it helped with my lethargy, weight and even depression.  It&#039;s pretty good if you take as prescribed. If you stop taking it suddenly, the effects of hypothyroidism come back pretty quickly and severely so I recommend taking it as your doctor states.",UNK

I found that the Effexor helped with my anxiety/flashbacks/depression a little bit. I noticed headaches at first and an increase in blood pressure. I cannot miss my dose or I get bad withdrawal symptoms (headaches, flu-like symptoms, diarrhea, brain zaps, dizziness, weakness, and fatigue) which only subside 6 to 12 hours after I take the missed dose.",UNK
3308,"I drank the first bottle right down, doesn&#039;t taste bad at all. It went down smooth.  I immediately drank the two 16 oz cups of water.  Felt bloated and a little nauseous but that went away.  It took awhile for it to start working.  Had lemon water ice and the taste goes away immediately.  I was extremely nervous about this because of the side effects more than anything.  Have some cramping.  Will take the next bottle at 10:00pm.  I hope it works faster and I can get some sleep.  7:45am procedure. I don&#039;t even feel hungry after the whole day of just liquids.",UNK

The acne was occurring mainly on my chin, around my nose and above my lips. Now I&#039;m getting acne on my forehead, as well as weird cravings (which I have never experienced before). My skin looks far worse than before and much like a cookie.",UNK
3311,"This medicine only worked for the first month for me. I would take it as directed but then suddenly the pain came back with a searing vengeance. It may just be me because everything I have tried for the fibromyalgia has done the same thing. There were more side effects on the Savella then on anything else I have taken. It made me lose a lot of weight because I couldn&#039;t eat through the nausea, and the hot flashes were horrible. Overall this medicine has seemed to help a lot of people but it wasn&#039;t right for me.",UNK
3312,"I give this a 7 because it does work. BUT be very cautious of the side effects. I was on it for 2 years, first started on the regular dose, then switched to extended release as the medicine would &quot;wear off&quot; throughout the day. While it helped tremendously with my depression and anxiety (it was almost non-existent) the side effects alone were debilitating. I gained 20 pounds, would fall asleep midday (we&#039;re talking I had to pry my eyes open to keep from passing out in the middle of a conversation), I was tired ALL DAY. I sweat PROFUSELY and the dizziness I experienced from missing a dose by only a few minutes, plus the heart palpitations were enough for me to stop. ",UNK
3313,"I am a chronic pain patient and have tried dozens of medications for my pain. Opana works wonders through an IV when I&#039;m in excruciating pain, but the oral pills just don&#039;t help as much. My pain doctor switched me from Oxycodone 4 times a day to Opana 3 times a day and it didn&#039;t touch my pain. I did some research and it only absorbs 10% orally. It&#039;s good as an IV or injection medication but not as much as an oral pill",UNK
3314,"I am a 21 year old female. I was on Prozac for ten years (40 mg at the end) before switching to Effexor (37.5 mg at first, 262.5 mg now) because I was having issues with anxiety. I was ok for a while then I became extremely depressed and suicidal. My doctor increased my dose and although it did take away the misery and suicidal thoughts, I wouldn&#039;t describe myself as happy. I feel constantly tired, sleeping up to 16 hours a day. I can&#039;t work and social situations exhaust me. It took me a while to realize Effexor might be responsible for some of these symptoms. I am talking to a psychiatrist about changing my medication but I&#039;m very worried about the infamous withdrawl from Effexor.",UNK
3315,"I have been using the pill for two and a half weeks now and absolutely love it. I had previously used Sprintec, a generic over the counter pill that was free, and prior to Obamacare was 9 dollars a month with my insurance. I changed pills after my insurance refused to allow me to take yaz and the next best option was this. My skin is more clear, my attitude is happier, my sex drive is through the roof, and I think depending on your natural level of hormones, this pill can do great things for you. I don&#039;t approve of the cost, but thankfully my doctor said he will supply me with free monthly trial packets until my insurance agrees to cover yaz.",UNK
3316,"I have had problems with insomnia for years. After 8 years of taking Ambien, which worked great for several years, I built up a tolerance and asked my doctor about switching medications. He prescribed Trazodone, and after reading reviews, I had high hopes for the medication. Unfortunately, it did little to help my insomnia and left me with severe congestion and a headache. After 4 or so hours I would wake up with my mind racing and was unable to sleep. My doctor added klonopin. I feel asleep quickly but rarely got more than 4 or 5 hours of sleep a night. Very disappointed.",UNK
3317,"I took a full pill the first day, which was stupid, as I&#039;m very sensitive to medication. I felt like I was on speed. I was talking really fast, my hands were shaking, my heart was beating a million miles an hour, felt like an anxiety attack. I also got a horrible headache and nausea later in the day. I didn&#039;t take it again for a month and then I cut the pill into quarters. For a week I took 37.5 mg a day. I got a few headaches, dizziness and nausea through the day, but tolerable. 3 days ago I upped it to 75mg. I still don&#039;t feel any help with sleepiness! Still am dizzy, headaches, nausea, lack of appetite. But I&#039;m going to wait it out and keep upping it to 150 and see if it ever starts working. Hopefully the side effects go away soon!",UNK

Since being switched I haven&#039;t had any of those side effects the only thing that recently happen was my skin became really sensitive to the sun and I broke out in a rash from it.

I spot sometimes but other then that I have gained about 15/20 pounds after I got it, I get horrible cramps even though I&#039;m not on my period and I&#039;m always moody.

3327,So I got my nexplenon in October 2015. Its been ok so far I got my period for 3 weeks. After that its just been spoting here and there that I can deal with. What I can&#039;t deal with is the constant headaches. And I feel tired all the the time also have real bad stomach cramps,UNK
3328,Let me start about the insertion of the IUD. It&#039;s not just a small pinch especially if your cervical is small like mine it will hurt and after the pain is terrible bad cramping . After during my six week follow up I was scared to use a tampon because I was scared it was going to touch the string . How ever sex my sex drive decreased. Before I would be crazy now I&#039;m just okay but scared to be rough because I&#039;m still afraid he was going to touch it . And a lot of out the blew spotting and period . The cramping pain level is 8-10 depending on you . But it&#039;s go away come back five minutes later worse than before. I do not recommend you to get it terrible . I would rather have weight gain vs periods and weeks of spotting terrible cramps .,UNK
3329,I&#039;m 23 no children. It didn&#039;t really hurt that much going it. A few hours later I had bad cramps which were painful. My periods stopped only little spotting which was brill as I had heavy periods before. This is brilliant. But it&#039;s the cramps. They only last 2 mins but they are so intense and its nearly had me crying. But then I haven&#039;t had no cramps for 2 weeks but now I&#039;ve got them again. If it lasted longer I would of had it out by now cause the pain is unreal. I am happy about no periods  hopefully it will settle.

That is supposed to be the most painful part so it is worth asking if they can insert without them. If your cervix is positioned in the right way, they should be able to and the insertion will be far less painful! 2) I spotted/bled for about 5 weeks afterward, it was a pain but tolerable. Mild acne and cramps, bloating and some constipation. In fact, this week has been the worst cramping yet, not sure what to think.",UNK

I took a year break off of birth control before starting Beyaz.  So far, I have mixed feelings.  I have been feeling panicky, and moody, but again, I&#039;m not sure if that is a product of the birth control, or my GAD.

3354,"First time having a coloniscopy and am grateful to have found this site and read such a variety of experiences. I drank two doses of Gavilyte-G, totaling 4 liters after following a prescribed diet. I drank 2 liters starting at 6:30 p.m. one evening and the next 2 liters the next morning starting around 6:30 a.m. My coloniscopy was set for 12:30 p.m. that second day. For both the evening and morning doses, I drank abiut 8 oz every 10 to 15 minutes. For the first dose, it took three hours before the medicine really started to work, but once it did it was very effective. I went to bed around 12:30 a.m. and slept fine without disruption. The morning dose worked immediately. Skin burned at times, but vaseline helped.",UNK
3355,"this is the first review I&#039;ve left in anything ever because I think as girls it&#039;s important we have eachothers backs on things like this. FIRST. When you take this, be sure to have a bottle m of wine ready and some serious distraction. Don&#039;t think you can just pop it in and feel better in a few hours. This thing will burn and itch like the devil himself is inside of you, BUT. you&#039;re putting something in you that&#039;s expected to treat you over night that is really supposed to be span of 7-10 days. That&#039;s a whole lot of chemicals in your already sensative lady parts. So it will burn and itch like hell, and I wouldn&#039;t recommend it if you have a low pain tolerance. But if you can open a bottle of wine and clean your house. Promise it works!!!",UNK

3357,I was given this for migraines. I can&#039;t blame my doctor for prescribing this about 7 months ago when I told her I was a raging maniac who was blowing up faster than a ballon at a carnival on Seasonique....but as a result I have gained a disgusting amount of weight. My bra size went from a 34D to a 34F! Nothing fits comfortably on the top or bottom because my bottom grew as well. How is it natural to get your period for one day or not at all? The worst is I have LOST MY SEX DRIVE.,UNK
3358,"I was taking Xarelto for DVTs in my right leg. For the most part the drug went as expected. Until I got a nose bleed. When it started it was like any other. Then the bleeding started like a cut vein. And it would not stop. I was rushed to emergency at a local hospital, where they shoved 2 devices that were to help it stop. They did not work and the ER doc on hand had to put larger ones in. I was told at the time there wasn&#039;t any drugs that would slow the bleeding down. It was time and compression that worked. It scared the hell out of me. As of now I will not go back on it due to these effects. And also due to my work. If I got a bleed in the place I work, it&#039;d be disastrous.",UNK
3359,"Used Nuva for two years from 18yrs old to 20 and it was a dream come true, only positive side effects if any, easy periods, and no pregnancies. 
HOWEVER - after the 2.5 year mark I started having pain &amp; sensitivity in my left leg only, bleeding/sensitive gums, and worst of all chronic yeast infections. 
It all started happening out of nowhere so I went a while not thinking it could be Nuva. After many trials I took the thing out and now my gums, legs, and vagina are back in working condition.

I think NR has long term effects that aren&#039;t recognized yet. I had a great time with it for 2 years and suggested it to all my friends, but it really turned on me down the line.
 Luckily, you can just take the thing out and the hormones leave with it!",UNK

I didn&#039;t have to worry about taking it at a set time every day (which I was terrible at) and my period has completely gone away. About a week before I was due for the second shot, I noticed an increase in my acne on my face, chest, and back as well as some spotting. That was the first week of June 2016 and I haven&#039;t stopped spotting since. My acne has also gotten significantly worse and I have never struggled with acne like this before in my life - even as a teenager.

3369,I got this birth control put in around early October and today is March 11th. I&#039;ve scheduled to take it out on Thursday. I read a million horror stories on IUDs but figured every woman&#039;s body is different so I&#039;d try it. The insertion was EXTREMELY painful  but a really short process. The pain lasted about 40 seconds. Cramps lasted that day but then went away pretty quickly. About 4 months in I started getting UTI&#039;s every single time I had sex. Before I got this IUD I was having sex everyday with my bf sometimes 2 or 3 times a day and never had any issues with UTI&#039;s. I know how to clean myself and how to prevent them so clearly it was my IUD causing them. Also I&#039;ve now had my period for 3 weeks and cramp and back pain. Can&#039;t wait to remove it,UNK

My eyes clear up a little when I discontinue use of Lastacaft.",UNK
3373,"Overall, this birth control has worked for its intended purpose. However, it has upped my anxiety, given me depression, and I suspect that it has something to do with some other medical issues I have been suffering with.

I&#039;m much more depressed, and I have developed a case of anxiety. I have experienced several anxiety attacks after being switched to this pill.

3376,"At first Celexa really helped.  I had more energy, was happy and was like my old self.  That lasted only about 3 weeks before I started feeling bad again and wanting to sleep all the time. I also had a claustrophobic feeling like I couldn&#039;t breathe.  I told my doctor and he also prescribed trazodone to take with it because he thought this would level me out.  The combination of the 2 made me dizzy, sick and very tired all the time. I couldn&#039;t even wake up when my baby was crying in the room next to me.  Needless to say, I had to quit taking the medicine.  I wished it would have continued to work like it did those first 3 weeks.  Also, I started to eat more after the euphoric 3 weeks were gone.",UNK

In addition, the painful pains in the abdominal were like having menstrual cramps. Oh but the sugar pill week! The WORST PERIOD EXPERIENCE. I go to university and I had to leave class because I had explosive diarrhea and when I say painful I mean excruciating cramps and blood clots falling out of my vagina every time I went to the bathroom (sorry for getting too personal).

However, when after 6 months I needed to refill my prescription and the pharmacy was out of the Heather tablet, I let them give me what they had, Jencycla (made by Lupin), figuring all minipills were the same. Within a few days I noticed significant changes in my mood, like collapsing into tears at the slightest provocation and getting angry at and suspicious with my boyfriend for stupid reasons.

After three or four months things started to change. I started feeling a bit depressed with some anxiety. What was really strange is that I would get lots of work related anxiety -- things started bugging me at work that normally would not. It&#039;s like small things at work bugged me far more than usual. I could not understand what changed. In addition, I was accumulating some depression and everything took more energy to do.

After it was put in, I found that in the first week I lost a great deal of hair, perhaps two fist fulls, this was a potential side effect so it didn&#039;t really bother me as it was only triggered by the initial release of drugs into my body. I had no period for 6 weeks and I was ecstatic! It lasted only three days, with light flow followed by a day of spotting. My third period lasted three weeks but was still light and spotting. June6 I got my period again and I still have it today (Sept15) I&#039;m looking for an alternative now. ITs an effective contraception though.",UNK
3411,"I got this implant in September of 2015. The reason that I got it was because I wanted to regulate my hormones better (I had really bad period symptoms) and I am too forgetful to do the pill. I thought it was great at first, recommended it to everyone. Now that I&#039;m farther down the line, I hate it. I was pleased that I didn&#039;t bleed for almost half a year, but when my periods came back, they came back worse. I now bleed for 3-4 weeks at a time, with 3 weeks in between. It is awful. I also get really bloated and have sensitive breasts, which are symptoms that I never had in the past. This thing definitely prevents pregnancy because every time I am in the position to have sex, I can&#039;t because I am bleeding.  I plan on having it removed soon.",UNK

My skin is clearer and soft in the forehead and my chin but i still have spots. Over this month i had to go through the itching, peeling skin and burning, my eyes looked terrible (i didn&#039;t put the gel over my eyes). Last week it literally burned my skin around my eyes.I think peeling is the worst. I am going to the college and my skin was always my weak point - it looked terrible the skin was peeling from my eyes, chin, nose, everywhere. I couldnt do anything - trying to take off the dead skin was irritating it and when i tried to moisture it and cover - it didnt worked. But i think i will give it another try.",UNK

Being a hypnotic it does cause you to do things in your sleep you might not remember when you wake up. For example: After taking it one night, I woke up the next morning to find myself soaking wet. I had a bottle of water on my chest. I had poured the water all over myself during the night and had no memory of it. This is just me though, some people have no problems with this medication.

I loved how light Loestrin made my cycles but I won&#039;t take it due to all this weight retention. I&#039;ve even been working out more than before I started the pill!",UNK

3474,"I have been on this birth control for a little over a year now. I originally started because my periods were so painful I would pass out and overall it was irregular. The first week I was nauseas and really really sick. I have also lost ALL sex drive and my boyfriend thinks I&#039;m not attracted to him anymore. My skin became really sensitive so ever time I&#039;m exposed to the sun for long amounts of time I will develop a rash. It also took my body some getting use to; lots of spotting the first fue months. Overall, I think this drug does it job, but the side effects are just too much for me.",UNK
3475,"I have just started Savella about a week ago I am praying this will work for me. I have gained about 80lbs on the other (Lyrica and Nerotin) ). I know it has helped with the pain already, I am hopeful and the only thing I noticed so far is I think my restless legs are doing a little more jumping. I guess time will tell.",UNK
3476,"So first off I got the paraguard inserted in which was very painful, but fast. I ended up have extreme cramps a couple days after getting it causing me to miss work. A month after after everything seemed great sex felt normal and it seemed like it wasn&#039;t even there. But once my first period came I had the worst cramps of my life to where I felt dizzy almost to the point of passing out! I was so freaked out I ended up going to the emergency room; because it was the weekend and I didn&#039;t want to wait to see my gyno.I had bacterial vaginosis  it was extremely painful so I realized I had to get it taken out and as soon as I got the paragard taking out the dizziness is gone the nausea was gone I had no more symptoms I do not recommend it!",UNK
3477,"After having a baby my anxiety increased dramatically. Anxiety attacks all the time. Didn&#039;t want to be around people and was super paranoid about flu season and the baby. Terrible moods and could go from ok to angry in minutes. I would have panic attacks if I had to leave the baby and was extra particular about cleaning and routine, to the point of ridiculousness. I have been on 25mg of Zoloft for 1 month and I can finally relax! My mood has improved greatly. I&#039;ve been able to go to work, socialize,and grocery shop. Zoloft has not helped with sleep. Even on 0.5mg of clonazepam at night, it still takes me hours to fall asleep. Having vivid dreams/nightmares and restless sleep. Hope those stop because I feel like myself again taking the Zoloft.",UNK

3479,This is my 4th colonoscopy/bowel prep:  First dose and fluids went down ok despite some nausea.   Second dose made it down followed by some water.  But 20 minutes later when sitting on the throne the nausea welled up and I started vomiting.  Did manage to catch some in the waste basket next to me.   Dr. did not complain about my preparation so I think it was fairly good despite losing most of the second dose.    However the Prepopik I took for a previous prep was much easier on me and was also deemed a good clean prep.,UNK
3480,"I switched from synthroid to armour last year and felt better for the first couple of months. I&#039;ve had an on again off again scalp itch/rash that I could not figure out for the life of me. About 6 months into armour I was overwhelmed by all my sympotoms, fatigue, depression, low libido, joint pain and the scalp itch/rash just would not go away. My endo let me try a 30 day supply of Tirosint and the rash went away and I felt so much better. Just to test my theory I went back to armour after the 30 days. Very quickly I realized it was DEFINITELY the armour and I&#039;m going back to tirosint. Armour is SO much cheaper but not worth it!",UNK

My pain is far from being gone but, knocks it down to about a 5, where I can meditate and relax and not laying in bed or sofa waiting for night to come to go to bed.  I am hoping with more time, this will be a God send since I am allergic to 99% of the medicine here.  Only negative is I get a mild headache, but fingers crossed!",UNK

I happen to be out of my Albuterol inhaler until I see my doctor later this week, so I&#039;m experiencing Qvar with no backup system, and I find it to be very ineffective against my asthma. I&#039;m using it twice a day, two puffs each time, as prescribed, and though it doesn&#039;t make my asthma worse, it doesn&#039;t appear to improve it either. Except for short spurts during the middle of the day, which might just be incidental. Anyway, I&#039;m going to ask my doctor for another alternative to Advair because Qvar&#039;s just not working.",UNK
3484,You want to die. Honestly I don&#039;t even know why I did this. Just trying to save money so I don&#039;t have to pay for a doctors visit. I mistakenly took the 1 day with the idea that hey if it&#039;s going to burn at least just for one day but WOW. I AM CRINGING FROM HOW BAD THIS BURNS. I wish I never had lady bits to begin with. This is horrible and I&#039;ll never do it again even if it does work.,UNK

I take relpax for migraine as needed but cannot take more than  8 a month. I&#039;m already at 11. It&#039;s the only thing that helps.

3486,"Diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder I was very hesitant at the start to try medications and thought I&#039;ll battle through with the help of therapy. 3 months later I gave in for medication. Couldn&#039;t get through a day without my anxiety being an obstacle. Was prescribed Zoloft for the first time at 25mg. For the first week things were fine just the usual upset stomach and dry mouth nothing I couldn&#039;t handle but surprisingly it made me depressed (never was) but anxiety DID settle a little (hence 5/10). Then was pushed up to 50mg... the upset stomach stopped the dry mouth decreased but restlessness and insomnia kicked in including the zombie feeling. This went on for over 2 weeks but had to stop, it was affecting my work. Withdrawal symptoms, depression.",UNK

3488,"I&#039;ve been taken Chateal for 7 months now. It&#039;s been effective the whole time I&#039;ve been on it but it&#039;s been a horrible experience overall. It did not help with my period in any way. My periods are still the same length, they&#039;re heavier and my cramps are worse. Acne never played a part in this as a side effect since I&#039;ve never had a problem with acne. Taking Chateal literally made me feel insane. I have never in my life felt so sad and angry and depressed for no reason. I used to only cry getting close to my period and now I cry all the time the whole month about anything. I constantly felt depressed without a way out because I couldn&#039;t figure out why I felt this way. No one should have to feel this way.",UNK

3491,"Wow, a lot of people have had experiences with this. I&#039;ve used this product once before years ago and it worked fine then. I&#039;ve never taken any other medication for a YI aside from a 7 day treatment. I switched to a new brand of soap (ULTA brand shower gel) and my vagina wasn&#039;t really the same. After using wayyyy too much other scented soap (dumb, I know) I realized I had a problem so I bought the Monistat 7 day. I get a lot of itching shortly after application, but no burning or discomfort. Sometimes it itches through out the day, but it&#039;s nothing unbearable. As far as I can tell, everything seems to be working just fine. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever take a 1 or 3 day application. I&#039;m 27, never had kids, have sex about once a month.",UNK
3492,"First, I want to say how terribly saddened I am to see the comments from so many women about endometriosis and taking birth control pills to &quot;cure&quot; it. It goes to show how severely inadequate and ignorant our health care system is when it comes to women and this debilitating disease. Birth control does not fix endo. It does not cure it. The ONLY treatment that has a chance of curing endo is expert excision surgery by a skilled surgeon.  Laparoscopy is just a diagnostic tool. Not a treatment. Birth control can help some of the symptoms for some women. But it does nothing to actually fix it. Please ladies, ask questions, research your disease. Most doctors still don&#039;t know the basics of endo, which is frightening!",UNK

I would not recommend it, I&#039;m sure you can get another eye drop that works just as mediocre for much less!",UNK
3494,Just started a week ago.  Was nervous regarding side effects but bit the nerves.  Notice there is no flaking after one week.  Although still itchy hopefully that goes away.  Just felt like I was exhausted faster but want to keep giving it a try.  Tried everything else.,UNK

I did spot for several months and then it almost completely disappeared.  I now go without periods except the occasional spotting (I would estimate this at 3-4 times a year). It has been great. I have not gained weight or had problems with acne.  I do still have the PMS symptoms every 3 to 6 months that last around a week.  Sometimes they are worse that others.  I almost always spot after the PMS symptoms.  I have also gotten 2 ovarian cysts since the placement that lasted several weeks and were painful.

Within the second almost third week I started bleeding dark brown blood but only a small amount. As the week went by it got heavier and red. I am currently still bleeding and its been 2 weeks which is frustrating since my periods usually last 2 to 3 days. What is really nice about this pill is that my body hair has stopped growing, or least grows very very very slow. It&#039;s not spectacular so far but I&#039;ll have to leave a review in 6 months to log some more long term progress.",UNK
3498,For the most part I liked the mirena. The only problem I had with it that I see no one mentioning is that I had heavy discharge to the point of having to wear a pantiliner everyday or it looked like I wet myself. On the pill now and the discharge is normal again.,UNK
3499,"Tramadol is a very good medication for moderately severe pain. For Bad Pain, taking it with an NSAID markedly improves it&#039;s effectiveness, as you are now acting systemically on both the inflammation and neurologic components of pain. Taking it with a caffeinated beverage, (such as cola, or coffee, etc), can also help, as can B Complex &amp; Magnesium.  Hot or Cold packs to the affected area (depends if the painful area feels Hot or Cold, one will make it better, the other one makes it worse usually in my experience). Also massage may also help. Acupuncture works synergistically I have found. Note: There are many &quot;Generics&quot; for this Med, Only the original &quot;Brand&quot; &amp; The Mylan Generic really work the same in my experience.",UNK

She wouldn&#039;t know when she had to use the restroom (couldn&#039;t feel the urge or full bladder feeling when she had to pee and would wet herself). Very embarrassing for a pre-teen girl! Once she was taking this medication (5mL once a day) it seemed to help her greatly, no more accidents. Then Dr said we could start weening her down on her dose, and even skipping a day in between if my daughter felt comfortable with doing so. Accidents came back on every single &quot;weening&quot; regime. Side effect for our daughter (now 12yrs old) is she has memory loss on this medicine, to the point that this medicine is just not worth it.",UNK

Today, I couldn&#039;t even leave the house I was so lethargic from the medicine.  I stayed home, didn&#039;t even change clothes, and laid on the couch with my eyes closed for hours.

3503,"Efficacy never in doubt with this fast acting benzodiazapine. Alprazolam works on the neuro-transmitter GABA to induce calming effects. It is useful to many patients who try it and is preferred over similar medications because of its relative safety. Regardless of how it is used, it is very potent and may be habit forming. A typical dose for a recreational user or someone addicted to this drug may be many times what would be considered safe. If taking Xanax more than 4 mg per day then slowly taper.",UNK

The only thing I can say was that around the time I got my period, my face was the clearest it ever was and then as soon as my period stopped, I began to breakout again. I think with this birth control I did gain weight, probably around 15-20 pounds. It also made me very moody. I never got so upset/mad as easily as I did when I was on this. I felt like an emotional wreck at times because I would get mad so easily and I hated it. I decided that this birth control, while effective for preventing pregnancies, was not for me.",UNK

Neurontin seems to work the best for me. I take Neurontin in order to manage my pain. However, if I have an especially painful episode, an extra dose goes to work quickly - within 30 minutes or so.  The one draw back for me is the it causes me to gain weight. 5 lbs the first month, and within 6 months approximately 10 lbs total gain. I know that is a side effect for me, because I have been on and off Neurontin 3 times in the past 6 years and have had this same side effect.

I thought there was a more serious issue due to the intensity but everything checked out fine, it was the medication. I would not recommend this medication.",UNK

With that, came more stress than I bargained for along with the stress of the rather long commute in horrible traffic. Long story short, I&#039;m on Zoloft now for a week and most of the symptoms have gone. I&#039;m feeling far more emotionally leveled and my thoughts are far more clear.

Get immediate medical attention if these appear.  On day 21-22 I felt terrible, just like I had the flu.  On day 24 I noticed several Aphthous Ulcers (something I had never had before).  These progressed to a level that I had to go to the ER on day 26.  On day 25 I discontinued Chantix and on day 38 I am still being treated for this.

I had brain fog, headaches, dizziness and heightened anxiety, which made me feel worse. The doctor did warn me that it can make side effects worse for 4-6 weeks, then you gradually start to feel better. He asked me to persevere with it, but as a mother of 2 young kids, I couldn&#039;t handle the side effects. I was literally bed ridden. I had to ask my mother to help me with the kids, as the side effects were too much. I called my doctor and relayed the symptoms to him and was advised to discontinue the drug, if I felt it was too much. It took 2 days for the side effects to wear off.",UNK

However, this pill did regulate and lighten my periods but not without terrible, terrible cramps. I also started noticing hair loss over the last year but that could be due to stress.

Tried it one more time with the same results. So I compromised and took 15mg per day. Still little to no noticeable help- and I was always mildly nauseous (always took with a full meal).

Since then I&#039;ve started waiting 30min before applying and I definitely don&#039;t rub it off in the shower. I&#039;m still just at twice a week and having dry flaky skin within two days of applying-makeup looks awful. So I went to a derm who is also the owner of a med spa.

My husband has been on it for close to 5 years. He used to be so angry all the time about everything, this helped him. It helped us because I am a person who does not do well with yelling and arguing. He did try to stop a few months back and it was terrible because his aggressiveness and irritability was off the wall, scarey. His mood swings came on quick and he realized he was better off staying on the Paxil. We are both on 40 mg a day. ",UNK

The Bad: Insomnia, minor tremors/twitching, irritability, increased anxiety, frequent mood swings, periodic feelings of hopelessness and apathy throughout the day (but are more manageable than they had been before), decrease in desire to socially interact, loss of concentration.

After 2 years being OK on the medication suddenly the thyroid levels are dropping again, hair falling out, skin is breaking out in itchy red welts, gaining weight, so Dr upped the dosage.  A couple weeks on higher dose I feel like I am &quot;wired&quot; in high gear, can&#039;t sit still, talking to myself going in circles, and my hot flashes have really really ramped up big time. Dr. says to give it at least 60 preferably 90 days to adjust, not sure I can hold out that long before stopping it. Hoping there is a better solution out there someplace.",UNK

The side effects were really quite bad, thus had to cut back to 225mg, this dose works very well. Some doctors are quite quick to push up your doses if your progress is slow. My advice is give it plenty of time before increasing doses. More isnt always better. Effexor is a good drug just somtimes can be a little slow working, the withdrawal from cutting down tablets wasn&#039;t really that bad at all; as long as you take it slow. Good luck to everyone who takes this drug.",UNK

Then I would have a few weeks off and then a month or so back onto bleeding and so on. I experienced bloating and weight gain that was explainable to me (I was not thinking about the birth control) because I have very high metabolism. I am a self conscious teenager and actually ended up stopping eating out of fear.  When I came on this birth control I wanted to prevent pregnancy and stop my period. Only one of those was achieved. So, while it is a good birth control, I find the side effects too unbearable.",UNK
3650,Okay so I have been taking Necon for 9 months because of heavy cramping and long periods. The first couple of months were fine. I was just always emotional and sometimes have a bad attitude. The last past month I have been kind of depressed and having anxiety attacks. It didn&#039;t come clear to me that it was the pills until my friend stated that was once her side effect. I have put on a couple of pounds and I am now able to feel out a complete D cup. (Unfortunately) and my  acne isn&#039;t as bad as it was. It&#039;s a 50/50 good product.,UNK
3651,I have been on a weight roller coaster since my early twenties. Since my family history of early demise of heat/health issues due to weight I decided to take a stand. I have lost pounds and regained pounds. I did some research online and found this medication. As stated I had to do some talking and consulting with my physician to try this. I will put it simply in the 14 day &quot;dosing&quot; period I lost nearly 15 lbs. I have been on Qsymia for a little over two weeks now and started on the 7.5MG and I have lost a little over 21 lbs. I must admit I was a little aggressive on the exercise but I do not think I was able to do this even as a teenager. Truly excited about what the future holds for this outstanding motivational experience.,UNK

For weeks I had horrible headaches to the point where I couldn&#039;t think, and then had terrible mood swings. Effective as a contraceptive, because I didn&#039;t get pregnant, but I was confused as to why I didn&#039;t feel like myself at all. After I figured out that it was probably Kariva, I stopped immediately.  I had no clue birth control pills could make me that crazy! After a month, I felt much better. Not taking this ever again.",UNK

The issues I&#039;m having is contant spotting. I&#039;ve been bleeding lightly (where I have to wear a light pad so I don&#039;t ruin my underwear every day) for two months now. The office told me about a month ago that my spotting is normal and most likely means once I stop spotting I&#039;ll be done with my period for the five years Kyleena is good for.

No real physical side effects apart from extreme sun sensitivity. This REALLY bothers me because I&#039;m extremely fair skinned and burn so easily - frequent, and I mean FREQUENT reapplications of sunscreen and sun avoidance are a must for me.

I was diabetic, had high cholesterol, had high triglycerides, and my Prolactin level was doubled.  I was on the lowest dose so she told me I had to go cold turkey and gave me benzos other than Xanax to lessen the symptoms.  Coming off Rexulti has been the worst experience ever.

3760,"I got the kyleena IUD inserted about 3 months ago and not only was it THE WORST pain I&#039;ve ever gone through, I&#039;ve had so many issues and side effects. Ever since I got it inserted, there has been an annoying throbbing pain in my uterus and despite checkups and pap smears, theres nothing wrong with it. I also had a very early miscarriage on this birth control which was extremely hard on myself and my boyfriend. ALSO I have the worst break outs of my entire life on my jaws, neck, and hips. Gained 15 pounds as well. Would never recommend this birth control to anyone ever. Long story short, I have an appointment next week to get this demon contraption out of me and I am exploring a different type of contraceptive.",UNK

3762,"I was diagnosed with depression about 6 months ago and started with a very low dose of prozac. About 3 months later I was institutionalized and switched to Zoloft. Most of the people there for depression were on it and it worked for them. However, it does not work for me at all. I&#039;ve been on 100 mg for about 2 months and I feel jittery when I sit for too long or when I&#039;m trying to sleep, I get really grouchy and rude (which is unusual for me) , and things that only bothered me before make me really depressed.",UNK

I have absolutely NO sex drive. I have acne breakouts on my lower chin every now and then. I&#039;m very moody and I&#039;ve noticed other mental issues with matters such as memory. This birth control does it&#039;s job well at preventing pregnancy but everything else is a negative for me. I&#039;m not speaking for anyone else but this is not agreeing with my body. I will be having it removed as soon as possible. I tried to wait for my body to adjust to it, but I think I&#039;ve given it enough time.",UNK

3766,At first I thought this was a miracle drug but after about 2 months they had to double  my dosage then in about another 2 months later the same thing. Next thing you know I&#039;m on the max dosage with no symptom relief. OMG that&#039;s when the real nightmare started. It was almost impossible to stop. I was ready to check in a a hospital. My doctor did watch me and did her best to get me off the medication safely but it was really really hard. Even though it did not help my fibromyalgia I suffered from withdrawal. Please PLEASE really read the side effects before taking this medication.,UNK

If I can give any advice, EAT A FULL MEAL BEFORE YOU TAKE THE MEDICATION! If you don&#039;t eat, you will be extremely nauseous and throw up.  I hate forcing myself to eat, but if it prevents the nausea, I will do it.  You need to eat 4 meals per day.  DRINK PLENTY OF WATER ALL DAY!!!!  The mornings are hard, because you do wake up nauseous, but the first thing I do is grab a bottle of water and drink some.  I ended up with the darkened stool and diarrhea, but other than that everything has been going fine.",UNK

I&#039;m easily depressed then I&#039;m super happy like it&#039;s confusing. This is not kool but like I said it is still new for me so I&#039;m going to give it time.

3770,"Very effective for pain relief.  For me the itching and long lasting (up to a month after use) red squares in all areas where the patch has been applied are serious setbacks. Several solutions have been suggested but none of them have helped. Because of the itching and the efforts to reduce it, the patches tend to fall off. It seems I scratch the area at night and dislodge the patch. Any abnormal stress in my life tends to aggravate these side effects. But as stated they work for pain relief.",UNK
3771,"As a healthcare professional I was excited to try this medication as I have been on numerous pain medications all of which are CII&#039;s. I thought, wow this could be a great new medication. For pain control, it has been okay, not the best, I have been on this 2 months at the 300 level, I was just switched to the 600 level, so we will see if it improves. Buckle delivery is different - placing it on your cheek, it does not always dissolve, even when the mouth is wet. It does leave a residue on my teeth and cheek, again with a wet mouth as instructed.  It is some times un able to sick, wet ten mouth and all, so it will curl up and I end up swolling it, but not able to dose again until 12 hours later.

So far, the only thing that stands out is depression/moodiness. Everyone has a different body chemistry and I&#039;m assuming that since I am already a relatively moody and anxious person (though NOT a depressed person), Ocella heightens the moodiness. It got especially bad right before my period, I was doing a lot of crying for no reason. I feel better now, after my period, and hoping it continues. No other problems to report but I&#039;ll check back in a few months with anything noteworthy.",UNK

However, in the last month or two, I have had serious mood swings, crying spells, and have been extremely sad. I thought this may have been due to stress, but after reading many of these reviews I feel my moods may be due to the Implanon. They are unbearable. I am sick of being sad all the time and it is causing problems with my relationship with my boyfriend. Besides the major mood changes, Implanon was good for me.",UNK

I think once I have the symptoms all gone it will be easier to hit the gym anytime I want again to get back to 150. Overall, the voices are there daily but will be gone soon enough",UNK

I cut out caffeine and tried walking more and decided to try it again for a week but no change. I just couldn&#039;t take it.",UNK

After a several days I levelled out, now all I know is I cannot move a muscle in the morning, until l have had my dosage with other painkillers too (tramadol).

I went 5 days and was seriously thinking about giving up but I had read that the side effects would get better and sinse I had the free trial for 2 weeks I wanted to keep trying. I didnt lose anything either and still felt hungry. Finally the 6 day I didnt feel hungry and finally lost 1 lb. This morning down another 2 making that 3 lbs in 6 days. Well Im willing to finish the 2 weeks before I decide. Im not as dizzy the 6th and 7 th day it has gotten a little better. All I can say is Im thankful for only one side effect so far and I finally dropped 3 lbs and I noticed on day 5, 6 and 7 Im not as hungry.",UNK

3827,"Started with Percs, moved to straight oxy at 100-120mg/day. Never beyond that. Tried a half dozen times to go cold turkey.  Not much luck.  Closest I have ever gotten is with Sub.  Problem is that with Sub you are still just taking opiates in a slightly different form.  That&#039;s why it &quot;works so well.&quot;  The problem comes when you stop the Sub. The hardest jump is from some opiates to NO opiates. No matter what, you&#039;re going to experience withdrawal.  You have to pay the piper at some point, even though some methods (like a taper) might make it a little easier.  Anyone who says that withdrawal is just a weekend on the couch is selling you a bill of goods (or, is the doctor encouraging you to take the pills). Be prepared for 10 days.",UNK
3828,"I was very unsteady on my feet, at first some of the pain was resolved, but it didn&#039;t work. Even though my feet were NOT swollen they felt that way, very tight feeling. It felt like I was walking on balloons, terrible feeling and I was afraid to walk with that unsteadiness. Didn&#039;t work for me, since then, I have been on many different medications. Neurontin, didn&#039;t help, amitriptiline, didn&#039;t help, Lyrica, didn&#039;t help. I am on nortriptyline now with a pain patch. The fentanyl patch really helps, but I don&#039;t want to stay on this forever, so trying different medications. I am only supposed to leave the pain patch on 3 days, and found with the new medication, nortriptyline, I can go 5 days. So I am hopeful here. ",UNK

I gave in and went to the Dr and he prescribed diflucan one dose and I took that, had no relief until he 3rd night. Felt totally normal for almost 48 hours and then the symptoms came right back and are even worse now. Hoping that even though it&#039;s my 5th day into treatment that it will be gone by day 7.

3830,"I started guanfacine around the age of 6 for Tourette&#039;s. I have been taking it for years and have had to constantly increase the dosage because my tics have progressively gotten worse. I eventually had to stop because of how bad the side effects were. My main side effects were dizziness, nausea, leg cramps, and digestive disturbances. As for effectiveness, it used to work amazingly. I would not recommend this drug to anyone with severe tics, or anyone who already struggles with nausea and dizziness. The side effects are more noticeable in large doses.
Pros:
- Safe for children
- Effective for mild to moderate Tourette&#039;s
Cons:
- Bad side effects
- For moderate to severe Tourette&#039;s, there are much better options",UNK

I feel stressed and depressed and I&#039;ve never been like that. I feel bad for my boyfriend and its been ruining our love life. I&#039;m calling my doctor to switch as soon as she is available.

My doctor originally prescribed Vicodin, then switched me to Lyrica in anticipation of my return to work. Lyrica was very effective at reducing the severity of the pain, but it caused me to be very drowsy. I slept for 14 hours a night, and had difficulty concentrating during the day. I would also have trouble remembering things I had done while taking Lyrica. I had to discontinue using it.",UNK

I only got this so I wouldn&#039;t forget to take the pill and for my periods because they were so heavy! I was on my period for about 5 months including the heavy spotting. I just recently got off my period a month ago and now it hasn&#039;t came back. This birth control makes me break out even worse, I know I&#039;m a teen and break outs are normal but come on I have it all over my back and chest and on my cheeks and I wash and moisturize twice a day. Also with this birth control it makes me very moody and slightly depressed. I highly do not recommend this type of protection. Personally I&#039;m thinking about going back to the pill.",UNK

Cardiologist said I was fine so I really don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on.  Had to stop the med pre-surgery for four days and the pains stopped.  Back on the med and they&#039;re back again.

I became depressive, in part because of knowing I had MS, but then again knowing answered much of my questions. It&#039;s hard for doctors to recognize these changes when they don&#039;t see you in your everyday environment.  It is important to discuss probable mood swings with your doctor.  State of mind is state of health, and being down in the dumps doesn&#039;t help MS progression.  I know many people who are on interferons and do well.  If I had my choice of the three available interferons it would be this one to start with.  Presently, I&#039;m not on any medicine and have 3 new lesions in the brain.

If the point is to be able to have sex and not get pregnant, I&#039;d say this one was a major fail. I&#039;m getting ready to have it taken out.

One minute I am constipated and the next I have diarrhea. Not cool. I cannot eat much at all, have NOT lost any sexual interest. Now that I am two weeks into the medication I am experiencing additional anxiety like heart palpitations and feelings of wanting to break down crying over nothing.

One time I had forgot to bring in the record and boom she puts me on Lisinopril 10 mg. I think the doctors get a kick back or something. She never talks of me getting off of it either.

I gained 20  pounds, which is odd as I eat well most of the time &amp; go jogging with my boyfriend.

3876,"I use this for nightmares related to C-PTSD. I was getting nightly terrors, just screaming nightmares every night related to flashbacks, I couldn&#039;t tell the difference between being asleep or awake and would wake up exhausted and stay that way throughout the day. 

With this drug, my nightmares have stopped, but I feel very dizzy and lethargic the next morning, and often more depressed. My sleep is much better, but the mornings are a write-off as I end up in tears for hours after waking. I guess the stress needs to escape somehow and instead of through sleeping, I get more of an effect upon waking. The drug does work to get rid of the nightmares, though.",UNK

I currently take spironolactone and epiduo, the combination is working great. I have experienced the medications side effects of having to use the restroom frequently and being dizzy if I get up too fast. To me, the side effects are very livable and easy to adapt to. I think it is important to note the severity of not getting pregnant while on this medication. I was warned that this medication can cause a deformity in male genitalia if you conceive while on this medicine. Always check with your doctor first.",UNK

The topicals and antibiotics helped, but very slowly. It&#039;s been over a year and my acne is still very bad.

Migraine stopped within a day but then started blotching on face and chest, having allergic reaction. After stopping, got HUGE rebound headache. Went in for my 1st time of Depacon via IV, which made me loopy, nauseous, uncomfortable. This happened for 4-5 hours 2 days in a row. Migraine was pretty much gone. Then put on Depakote at night by pill. Made me feel a little loopy but OK.

Then the bleeding started like a cut vein. And it would not stop. I was rushed to emergency at a local hospital, where they shoved 2 devices that were to help it stop. They did not work and the ER doc on hand had to put larger ones in. I was told at the time there wasn&#039;t any drugs that would slow the bleeding down. It was time and compression that worked. It scared the hell out of me. As of now I will not go back on it due to these effects. And also due to my work. If I got a bleed in the place I work, it&#039;d be disastrous.",UNK

It wasn&#039;t salty, just very sweet tasting.  Very tolerable.  Made my blood sugar spike for one hour.  I drank it in about ten minutes.  Used a straw at first, then just drank it out of the container.  I waited about five minutes, then drank one 16oz container of water in about 25 minutes by taking big sips.  Waited another five minutes, drank the second 16oz container in the same way.  There was some minor bloating but not too bad.  No cramping.  The Suprep produced results about 25-30 minutes after I started drinking it.  I would definitely use this product again!",UNK

I have changed my diet big time, no carbs, fish and lean meats, lots of eggs, tons of water and small snacks throughout the day. I feel good, no tiredness like others that I read.

For some reason my doctors never suggested the fact that it might be sprintec, but as of today I&#039;m going to stop taking.

I loved it at first - it enabled me to resume walking and sleeping through the night. But after 3 months I had upped the number of pills I was taking to the max 400mg/day because I was becoming tolerant to it. When I had to go off it due to surgery I decided to stay off it and experienced unpleasant withdrawal of sweats/chills and loss of appetite for about 4 days. Now I use a TENS device for pain at night (FDA recent approved a new device that can be worn at night) and am off tramadol. Tramadol was not a good long term solution for me.,UNK

It also caused sun sensitivity and increased/extreme sweating. Although I have not had another serious attack, the side effects way outweigh any benefit for me.

At first I wasn&#039;t sure if it was the birth control but I talked to other friends and they also had similiar problems. I also got very sore breasts which I never dealt with before so it really bothered me.

After long term use, my period became lighter and finally disappeared, which makes me paranoid about pregnancy, so I use an over the counter test every couple of months.

It was extremely hard for me to get aroused and when I did, there just wasn&#039;t enough lubrication in order to have painless sex.

3936,"I&#039;ve been on seasonale for two years it it&#039;s the first birth control I&#039;ve ever takenand I love the results!  My periods are shorter and less crampy, I&#039;m also no longer a hag during pms because pms doesn&#039;t exist for me anymore :)
I do occasionally get breakthrough bleeding but that&#039;s definitely my own fault for taking a pill a few hours late. 
My main complaint is that I cry way more now - watching cheesy commercials and when I&#039;m mad - and that I&#039;ve gained weight,  every time I restart my new pack I&#039;m starving all week and want to eat everything in sight.  My boobs obviously got bigger too but I&#039;m not complaining there. 
Still a thumbs up from me !",UNK
3937,"My 5 yr old started taking Vyvanse today and had a bad reaction to it while at school, severe itching with a twitch of his shoulder.  There was no outside signs of breakout.  Tried to contact doctor who prescribed and have received no reply, therefore after talking to pharmacist and school nurse, and health unit care provider, I have decided to stop Vyvanse, 30mg daily, until I receive some reply from his doctor. Then I am going to ask for something else.  If it works fine for your children, God bless, but please keep an eye on them for the first 24 hours; allergic reactions do occur, we were just lucky it was not more severe.",UNK
3938,I had really bad cystic acne and went to a dermatologist and the medicine they gave me didn&#039;t help much so I went on Cryselle. My face has cleared up SO much ever since I&#039;ve been on this pill but I have been very moody. I&#039;ll be happy then sad to where I want to cry and then the next minute I&#039;ll be extremely happy again. I have not gained any weight while on this pill and I&#039;ll skip my period every 2 months and they&#039;re very light with no cramps. Overall I plan to stay on this pill until I can&#039;t deal with the mood swings anymore.,UNK
3939,I have been taking Contrave for 4 days.  I am 5&#039;2 1/2 and wgt 156.  I was taking phentermine but then I began to read about contrave and asked my Dr. for it. I have been taking it only four days I don&#039;t feel anything.  Does this medicine have to be taken for a while before it kicks in. I take one in the AM. I don&#039;t have any of the symptoms that I read about. I not sure about the cravings or eating to much because I feel like it may be a placebo effect.  Did anyone else have this kind of feeling.?  Should I just give it more time to kick in.?  Its not an inexpensive drug to keep taking if it doesn&#039;t work. I hope I am wrong and the weight loss will start happening soon as it did for some of the people I have read about.,UNK
3940,"I&#039;ve had insomnia for years. Finally had a sleep study done and it turned out I have moderate sleep apnea along with restless legs syndrome.

Was prescribed a CPAP and Trazodone. Currently taking 300mg per night. It puts me to sleep fast but I always wake up after 3 - 3.5 hours of sleep. 

After reading others comments I&#039;m considering trying 450mg to see if that will keep me asleep.

3942,"I&#039;ve taken this medication for about two years. Everything about it is wonderful, except the cramps I get right before my period are so intense. I wake up in the middle of the night throwing up from the pain. I&#039;ve never been through or experienced anything like it and contemplate going to the ER every time it happens. It&#039;s like one intense cramp that won&#039;t let go for 30 minutes or so and typically leaves me in tears. 

I&#039;ve asked my doctor about it and he says it&#039;s normal, but after going through this every period, enough is finally enough. I&#039;m going to ask to switched back to a typical 1 month dosage. 

Otherwise, it&#039;s been wonderful only having a period every 3 months with little side effects!",UNK
3943,My experience with the implant has not been the best but it had done the job. I got my implant April 2015 and soon after I got it started my period and it ended like normal. 5 weeks into the implant I started my period again and this time it wasn&#039;t going away my period last 4 months and first 2 weeks were heavy bleeding and then the next few months were light bleeding and spotting. This affected my sex life as I didn&#039;t want to have sex on my period or even when I had spotting.  My situation now is I refuse to take it off as I didn&#039;t experience any weight gain depression or any other weird mood as that is caused my my family. Now about 1 year and 4 months into the implant I still get prolonged bleeding bleed for 2 months  &amp; spotting 1 month.,UNK

The past 4 weeks my doctor increased it to 3 times a day, because my blood sugar started to go up to 152-240. I wish I knew what happened. My diet is the same and at first I lost weight and now am at a stand still. Maybe I should change. I have trouble sleeping and take something for that. Hope it will change soon.",UNK
3946,"I started phentermine 37.5mg in March 2011 and weighed in at 180. By the end of April I was down 20lbs to 160. It gave me energy and really suppressed my hunger, but I had horrible dry mouth, constipation, irritability, and had to force myself to eat. Since I stopped, I have gained 10 lbs back in 7 months and is entirely my fault. I have started it back up again because to me the side effects are worth the outcome. It loses it&#039;s potency after a couple of months, but still suppresses the hunger more than without it. As long as I am dedicated to the program, I should be able to take off the 10lbs I gained and then some within 2 months time. My realistic goal weight is 145 and is totally doable with healthy habits.",UNK
3947,"I have been on this drug for about a year. I went up to the highest dose I could (225mg). A year later, I started feeling better. Little did I know, that this drug would give me bad headaches, night terrors, constant over sweating and weight gain. The over sweating is unbearable, if its hot outside, don&#039;t bother wearing make up, it will come right off. You&#039;ll be sweating buckets while no one else has shed a single drop. The weight gain ruined my self esteem as well. If I would have known these side effects, I would have never started it. I am currently going off the drug and I am bracing my self for the days following my dose going to 0mg.",UNK

I have literally been cramping for a week straight, I have no appetite, and I&#039;m also nauseous. The signs I have you would think I was pregnant. I&#039;ve read from many sites that its common for women to relate their experience to feeling like they are pregnant. Well I find this to be so bad that I will not get it again which is sad because I love it for the last 3 years. Needless to say despite the negatives it does the job and I never had a scare in 3 years it is seriously worry free.",UNK

 He began taking Ariecpt in November and Mamantadine in December. In five moths he has degenerated so rapidly that he is functioning at the same level as my mom was at in her last year of the disease. Every time the dose is increased he gets exponentially worse its noticeable almost daily.  I am in the process of titration him off both. I wish I would have research it better. I thought that was the doctors job. This is the first online review I have written. Grateful to hear that I&#039;m not imagining these side effects. Thanks",UNK
3950,I suffer from cold sores once a year usually October or  November but I find Abreva works well when first signs of cold sore appear. I can&#039;t ever seem to catch it at the &quot;first tingle&quot; usually wake up with one trying to pop out. I immediately throw on some Abreva then take some lysine pills and some Vitamin c. Seems to heal it fast . In like 3 days. If the blister sadly appears I use Abreva every other hour and take 2 lysine pills every other 4 hours. ,UNK
3951,"I have been suffering with insomnia for quite some time and have taken Ambien then finally Lunesta. The medication just didn&#039;t agree with me. I would often wake up in the middle of the night with a bad taste in my mouth and a nasty headache. When I did sleep, I would be washed out the morning after and very angry, irritable. I was becoming a different person and felt very sad. My fuse was short. Ask my family. I asked my doctor about Silenor and he gave me 3mg sample to try. I have never slept better in a long time. I woke up feeling fresh without the drowsy symptoms I had to put up with while taking Lunesta. No more attitude problem. Family loves me again. Also, I was a nut while on Ambien so forget that. I will stick with Silenor now.",UNK
3952,"Clindesse didn&#039;t work for me -- and it sure was expensive!  My doctor prescribed it rather than a less expensive alternative because it&#039;s a one-dose treatment.  Worked for about a month the first time, then back to doctor.  Second time it worked for a week.  Wasted a lot of money.",UNK
3953,"I&#039;ve got very mixed feelings about my implanon.  Had it in for over 6 months and not a hint of a period. No spotting or bleeding whatsoever = awesome!  I&#039;m more emotionally stable - no more crying every month with my period = great!  However, I have put on approx 8kg despite no change to eating habits or exercise = depressed! Plus it hurt for a few days after it was put in.  Previously I was on the pill for 25yrs and my weight was mostly stable I wore the same size work uniform for 7 yrs - but now I&#039;ve had to go up a size and the new uniforms are getting tight already.  I love not having to remember to take the pill, but I&#039;m seriously considering having the implanon taken out and going back to the pill.  The weight gain is just too big a pr",UNK
3954,I got the Implanton ... The insertion wasn&#039;t too painful the numbing stuff they put in first hurt the worst! I had a lot of spotting at first but now I don&#039;t really have a period at all. I have noticed a little weight gain but nothing too bad. The worst side effect is my loss in sex drive. It is GONE but I&#039;m hoping for my boyfriends sake it comes back. All in all I like the Implanon and think that it is a great choice for someone like me who will not remember to take a pill at the same time every day.,UNK

After massive amounts of research, I finally went to supplements, healthy eating, mindfulness, taking toxins out of my daily life, exercise and of course prayer.

3957,"After two valiant attempts to get past the adverse effects, I&#039;m finished with Depakote. The first attempt lasted a week; as it can exaggerate the effects of other meds, I became so drowsy I couldn&#039;t drive. For the second attempt, it wasn&#039;t combined with any other medication and lasted 3 weeks. I felt continually agitated and anxious, began to quickly gain weight, had terrible gas and was going to the bathroom 4-5 times a day. Additionally, my hair began to fall out so quickly, even my husband noticed (and he&#039;s NOT very observant!). The most disturbing symptom was the frequent presence of pronounced, irregular heart beats and at least one near-syncopal episode. All this in just 21 days-
 thanks but no thanks!",UNK
3958,I have been taking this pill for a good 4 months now. My breasts were very tender for the first two months and mood swings were horrible. I snapped at my boyfriend about everything. Periods do come within a day of when they are supposed to which is a plus and knock on wood I am still not pregnant. Also... my acne is NOT gone! It hasn&#039;t helped my face at all! My back and chest are much better but my face hasn&#039;t gotten any help. One other thing...it didn&#039;t seem to help any with cramps but mine were always mild in general so I don&#039;t know how much more it could be reduced.,UNK
3959,I&#039;ve been on this medication for 4 months and it has been awful. I originally got on it for my horrible stomach cramps and my irregular period. I will say that it has regulated my period and even made it light which has been great. But I have been sick almost daily. I have gained a bit of weight since I started taking it 4 months ago. I have awful headaches every day as well as stomach cramps. I would not recommend this medication at all!!!!!!!,UNK
3960,Okay so this is my first time having a YI I&#039;m 17 and I was so scared at first! I told my sister my situation and she recommended the monistat 7 saying the others didn&#039;t work. Well I&#039;m on night 4 right now and that pain is so horrible! The fact that you have to take the cream before bed makes it really hard for me to fall asleep. The pain gets so bad I have to distract myself so I won&#039;t burst out into tears. This has been such a long week and I dread every night I have to go to bed ,UNK

However, my acne increased and I was tired all the time. Also, I had terribly sore breasts and white vaginal discharge every last week of active pills. My periods became much lighter with less cramps. When I stopped taking the pill, my acne was 90% gone the next day! I couldn&#039;t believe it! My face looked cleaner than before I started this pill. I was off the pill for a month, and my acne still is very small (Which is good, because I used to have bad breakouts). Couple of days ago started taking LoEstrin 24, will see what it does.",UNK

3964,I have been on this pill for about 8 months because I had very bad cramps. It made the cramps completely go away and my periods only last 3 days. However I gained 10 pounds because the pill has made me have a larger appetite and makes me crave food all the time. I eat very healthy and exercise but the weight just wont come off. My doctor also told me this is because this pill makes you retain a lot of water which makes you bloated. ,UNK

All these symptoms are since starting Aubagio: Numbness/tingling in hands/arms, legs/feet, bladder issues, vision issues (can hardly drive at night anymore), no energy, headaches, and overall just do not feel like myself. So far no new lesions, but a host of side effects. Not sure it&#039;s worth it. Do your research!",UNK
3968,I had the Mirena 1st inserted with great pain in 2006.  After the initial pain of the insertion it was a miracle!  After a lifetime of heavy and irregular periods I actually stopped having periods.  After 5 yrs I had it replaced.  My new Dr. did the removal and insertion of the new Mirena under general anesthesia.   For the first year all was great. Then the unexplained spotting began..I was told it was stress... then bleeding and cramping for months that finally ended with bright red blood loss during sex... scared the heck out of my boyfriend and me... again dr told me stress was to blame.  I changed Drs and was informed that hormone changes which cause the bleeding during sex.  I am having it removed.   Too much at risk the 2nd time around.,UNK

I am 20, 5&#039;1 and normally weight around 107-109 but have been weighing around 111-112 ever since starting the pill.

I&#039;d say the worst side effect is my emotional state. I went from being a completely optimistic and happy person to feeling depressed and off balance every day. I&#039;ve cried almost every single day and for no reason. I hate this feeling. I don&#039;t feel like myself at all.

At first I chalked all that up to pregnancy till I figured it was the medicine causing this. I accidentally missed one dose and I felt horrible.

After trying numerous medications for over 17 years to help with depression, I was really hoping for more. I would say that as an add on to Prozac, it is only somewhat effective. At first I was pleased by the lack of noticeable side effects compared to other antipsychotics. It didn&#039;t make me groggy during the day, nor did I experience any muscle twitches. However, at about the third month on 20 mg, I began getting severe akathesia shortly after ingesting. It manifested with inner restlessness (not normal for me), anxiety, and inability to stop moving.

Started with 100mcg *Levothyroxine 5 days &amp; Synthroid 88-2 days a week.In a few months time I suffered some pretty severe side effects-EXTREME dizziness/weakness,lack of energy,mood extremes,weight is either climbing or stagnant,racing pulse/heartrate.We checked levels &amp; now TSH reads at the extreme low end of normal.I&#039;m scared please help.",UNK
3992,"I had the Mirena inserted after my child was born. He was six weeks old at the time and I was 36. Since then (a year ago), I have gained 12kg&#039;s (no change to my diet etc etc), have back and pelvic pains and inflammations all of the time and no sex drive. My marriage is struggling and my moods absolutely horrible. The gyne does not want to remove it as he swears by the Mirena and thinks I am overindulging and just full of nonsense. I feel horrible and bloated and moody 100% of the time. I need some help please.",UNK
3993,"My sleep has progressively gotten worse as I have grown older, now 60.  I have tried five other drugs with no success.  Lunesta worked better than others but would only work a couple of nights then nothing and I felt groggy and had constant headaches.
The doctor gave me Amitriptyline 50mg and the first night, while a little jittery I fell asleep in about 20 minutes and slept most of the night, getting up and changing rooms, then falling back to sleep again.  The second night I tossed and turned most of the night.  Tonight is number three so I am hoping that the side effects subside.  Will update in a few days.  I am still battling major headaches with this drug as I did with Lunesta.  Hoping for success tonight.",UNK
3994,I just started Sprintec a month ago because my birth control that i have been taking for 2 years stated to get to expensive. In the middle of my pack I started noticing a change in my appetite right away. I felt like every time I ate something I would have to throw up even if it was a cookie.  Not to mention the cramps I would get during my period.  On the Positive side it does prevent pregnancy so I guess its not that bad.,UNK
3995,"I began to have bruising around insulin injection sites; it looked like I was on anti-coagulants. I am having pain in my joints, and numbness and tingling throughout my body, including my face and tongue. I have a decrease in my ability to taste food. Also, I am bruising from mild injuries with dark purple areas at the site of the bruise.",UNK
3996,"Day 3 on Flagyl and Cipro. I thought I was having a heart attack. This stuff has horrid side effects. Discomfort in my chest and arm. Foggy headed feeling,  dizziness, unbalanced, headache, very nauseous,  metal taste, very blurry eyesight. 
No energy, at 55 it is not a good thing to feel this way, especially when you are overweight and out of shape. This is only day 3 I don&#039;t think I can take this stuff for 7 more days. They say the IV kind is worse though. Supposedly it&#039;s helping (I do feel less pain in my abdomen I think). IF I make it through this stuff I bet I will watch what I eat and make better choices in the future. I called the pharmacy and the doc and both said to stay on it, cipro 2X daily and flagyl 4X daily. Scary stuff.",UNK
3997,"Well, for the longest time I was on 20 mg and I felt okay. Which was a lot better than the constant anxious mood I was in and I could finally go to school. The last 3 weeks, I was on 40 mg after trying Wellbutrin and having a terrible reaction to it. But in the two days that I came off of celexa, only taking 20 mg again, I had the worst withdrawal symptoms. It might work for you but after a while it didn&#039;t work for me.",UNK
3998,I&#039;ve developed a rash on face. I had diarrhea but now no bowel movement and bloating. No appetite. Dry mouth. Extreme tiredness or exhaustion. Depression. I stopped taking 3 days ago.  I was taking the oral 500 mg 2x a day.,UNK
3999,"I started using the NuvaRing in early December 2013, and I stopped using it after my  month trial was up. I had a few side effects: weight gain(with no change in diet), headaches, NO sex drive, and periods that started a week early. I was on the pill for a year and a half with none of these side effects. The NuvaRing just isn&#039;t for me.",UNK
4000,"I started taking Zoloft after experiencing physical symptoms of anxiety at random moments and cyclical mood swings with depression that had a very strong physical component (I had nothing to be sad about I just ached and couldn&#039;t get out of bed or smile) The first week I took it I felt like I was in a complete fog. I lost my appetite, had upset stomach and it messed up my sleep. Once my body adjusted (about 2 weeks) I had more energy, was more engaging with my friends and family and the physical symptoms subsided. After about 3 months I moved and lost my medicines and stopped abruptly. The depression and anxiety came back tenfold because I didn&#039;t wean myself off. I felt overwhelmed with life. Zoloft works great but it&#039;s very powerful.",UNK
4001,"I&#039;m 16 years old and have had on and off yeast infections before I  ever knew what they were, but once I got this one I knew why i got it, BUBBLE BATHS! so I used Monistat 1 at 11pm and woke up around 2:30 am with very mild itching not at all worse than it had been previously. I used more of the itch cream and eventually could fall asleep at 3:15. I have mild burning when I urinate but it&#039;s only 9:35 am so the medicine is still leaking out. I would recommend this product so far because it seems to have worked! I also recommend taking AZO cranberry pills because they keep your ph on balance, so I will regularly take them now to avoid any more yeast infections. I had a great experience and feel terrible for the women who did not!",UNK
4002,"I had the paragard for about four months. The implantation procedure went well and painless (I have four kids) and the first month went by without incident. By the second month I started having unexplained nausea and dizziness, but thought nothing of it. Figured it was dehydration or poor eating habits. By the end of the second month I started getting heavy periods every two weeks and the nausea/dizziness became more frequent. I could barely get out of bed in the morning no matter how many hours of sleep I got. By the time I got it removed last week, I couldn&#039;t function. Nausea, dizziness, fatigue, horrible labor-like cramps in my uterus and back. I was miserable. Feeling 100% better since removal.",UNK
4003,"I have only been on this med for 3 weeks, however, I am very happy with the results so far.  Almost total clearing of plaques on my hands.  I have fought psoriasis for many, many years and this is the clearest my skin has been.  The only side effect I have had is occasionally nausea and diarrhea.",UNK
4004,"Out of nowhere, due to what they think is genetics, I got hit with depression, anxiety, and a form of OCD in my early twenties. The Lexapro was a life saver. Although, I still have negative thoughts on a daily basis, I&#039;m able to cope, and I&#039;m not miserable like I was. However, there is one common downside to this medicine that has left me terribly upset and frustrated. I&#039;ve been on Lexapro for a year and a half now and have put on about 20 lbs. I work out almost every day and eat right for the most part. I have not shed a pound. I&#039;ve never been this big before and to me, I feel as though Lexapro isn&#039;t worth it anymore. I&#039;m weening off of it with my doctor&#039;s help, and am going to try and cope with my issues with different methods.",UNK
4005,"I have always struggled with compulsive eating, and have yo-yo-ed up and down my whole life. I was a relatively normal weight when I was prescribed Vyvanse, not for binge-eating disorder, but ADHD. I felt AMAZING. I had incredible focus, tons of energy, and best of all, no appetite. For the first time in my life, I never thought about food and lost 30lbs plus. But it wore off earlier and earlier, so I was given bigger doses. Then the mania started. No sleep, my mind whirling all day, my behavior manic and crazy. I came off, and immediately gained 60lbs, turned into a zombie. The pharmaceutical stress this drug put on my body brought on tons of illnesses that are chronic and i now live with 6 years later. NOT WORTH IT. Disaster drug.",UNK
4006,I have been on Buspar for about 2 months now for anxiety from keppra. It seems to work sometime but when I get an anxiety or panic attack it hits hard. I was on 5mg twice a day and now my dose is really high. Like today it seems to have no effect. And I&#039;m always lightheaded dizzy fogged out feeling. And my other doctor said to try Xanax.,UNK
4007,I used to take 300 mg (prescribed) of this and it did nothing for me for sleep.  I took 600 mg (not prescribed that way) and it still did nothing for me.  Now I take 200 mg along with 200 mg of Seroquel and I fall asleep within an hour and wake up refreshed.,UNK
4008,"Lexapro made me feel good. I was able to control lashing out and crying. However, after a week of taking, something triggered me again. A horrible thing happened to me and made me take too much alcohol while on this medication. Messed me up and after that, a symptoms keeps coming up. Lexapro really made me hold on to my sanity but suicidal thoughts came up with the symptoms. ",UNK
4009,"I was very unhappy on this drug. My pain was not reduced as it should have been. I spotted for the entire 6 months I was on it. I was extremely depressed, had no libido whatsoever and gained 20 pounds. This did not work well for me for this condition at all. Unfortunately once it is in your system you are stuck with it. It took a full year for my body to readjust once I was off it and to stop spotting. It was also hard to lose that weight afterwards.",UNK
4010,"I&#039;ve been on Amitiza for about a year, and while it works, it doesn&#039;t work as well as If like it to. I tried the 24 mcg dose at first but it was way too strong, definitely makes you run to the bathroom all day. I then switched to the 8mcg capsules twice a day. If I take them on an empty stomach, I get really nauseated, so I usually take them with a meal. I still had to use Miralax and fiber along with the Amitiza to ensure I stayed regular. Sometimes with all of this, I still got constipated, so I would take a 24mcg dosage and deal with the aftermath. When I did have a BM with Amitiza, it wasn&#039;t a &quot;complete &quot; one. It would make me poop out water, but it felt like the bulk of the stool was still left inside. I stopped taking it.",UNK
4011,"I&#039;m giving this two stars because it helped me quit smoking, but that&#039;s all it did.  I&#039;ve been taking for almost two months now and my anxiety has greatly intensified.  I also have muscle aches in my legs and back - not sure if it&#039;s related to the bupropion, but I didn&#039;t have these feelings before I started taking it.  It did not help me lose weight, but I did finally plateau after gaining consistently on Paxil and Abilify.  I&#039;m still taking Abilify so maybe that&#039;s interfering with weight loss, I&#039;m not sure.   Also my depression was under control for awhile but with the relentless anxiety about everything, it&#039;s creeping back in.  Everything feels like an effort and all I want to do is stay in bed all day.  This medication is not for me.",UNK
4012,"I have been on Zoloft for the past two months now, and last week went up to 100 mg from 50mg. No real great dramatic feelings of elation and euphoria. I would honestly say though that it has diminished my depression quite a bit, and I am not quite as troubled by my regrets, which really bring me down as well as the living situation I am in now.
I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for the last six months and go back and forth between wanting to just end my existence, to realizing I don&#039;t want to end my life; I just want a higher quality of life.",UNK

4014,"I&#039;ve been on Brintellix for 4  months now.  It is providing a mild antidepressant/anti-anxiety effect, but definitely not robust enough for my lifelong generalized anxiety disorder and depression.  I&#039;d give a 3.5/10.  It&#039;s better for me than Viibryd (the medicine it most closely resembles), but I&#039;m still in a state of deep dysfunction.  On the positive side, the side effects have been minimal, the most prominent being some decrease in sexual desire and sexual pleasure.  (Not really an issue for me though since my anxiety and depression pretty much have a corner on that non-existent aspect of my life).  Also, even with my decent insurance, and Takeda&#039;s &quot;discount card,&quot; the cost for a month&#039;s supply of 30mg a day (the dose I&#039;m taking) is about $300.  Not affordable.",UNK

I also find that if I&#039;m late taking it, or if I take it after the rebound RLS starts, that it takes hours before it helps.  I usually end up taking Percocet to stop the painful twitching.  It&#039;s better than taking nothing at all, but I would love to go 24 hours without the pain!",UNK
4016,"This medicine made me feel absolutely horrible.  Funny chest feeling, foggy head, dizzy, and an overall bad feeling.  Never want to take again.  Last three days took 1/2 in a.m. and other 1/2 in p.m.  That was a lot better.  Have been off for about two weeks, and still a foggy and light headed.  Do not want to take again ever.  I am 71 years old and it is not recommended for older people.",UNK
4017,"I&#039;ve been on Yasmin for about a month and a half now. I didn&#039;t experience any side effects for the first two weeks of taking it, and then gradually I started feeling more moody, irritable and depressed. My sex drive also went away around the time it would normally be in overdrive. I haven&#039;t gotten any acne from this pill, nor weight gain. I did notice that I wasn&#039;t nearly as crazy just before my period like normal, so it has helped with actual PMDD so far. I&#039;m now halfway through my second month on it, and it actually seems better so far. My sex drive has improved and I haven&#039;t been moody or depressed. Still no acne or weight gain. I think this pill just takes time to adjust to your body  for some people.",UNK
4018,"I have been on this pill for 9 months after pregnancy, I don&#039;t feel that I&#039;ve gained any weight.  Although I eat well and recently within 2 months went back to the gym.  The worst part about this BC is the break through bleeding, for weeks at a time. Skipping periods...my cycle is most definitely unregulated since the 1st month.  I haven&#039;t gotten pregnant so that&#039;s great, but my husband and I are losing our sex life. 
I want to change, but I dislike when hormones are messed up.",UNK

As much as it is good to feel no pain the feeling that you could put a knife through you and you would not feel it makes you feel crazy.


My stomach is in pain from time to time and running to the loo.
My throat feel like I need to constantly clear it gritty in the back.
My mouth is so dry and a metal taste.

Thank Goodness I have one more day of this drug that is driving me crazy.",UNK

It&#039;s a good birth control, but this last shot I had is my last. Not good for my health, you would have to try it yourself and see if anything happens to you. I suggest watch it closely.",UNK

Four days after finishing the Macrobid, I started to itch all over my body from the top of my head to the soles of my feet. There&#039;s no rash present but my skin gets very sensitive and red even before I scratch (super red). Five days after taking the medication, I am experiencing tightness in my esophagus and burning; as if I had a bad case of acid reflux (I have a minor level of acid reflux). ",UNK
4024,"Used for 6 weeks to treat muscle spasms and phobia. After asking my doctor to wean me off we followed a regimen, and it was the worst withdrawal I have ever experienced in my whole life, even worse than things that I&#039;ve taken in the past.

I suffered temporal epileptic seizures for 3 days, and was staring at the door for an hour before my girlfriend smacked me to wake me up. 6 days later I suffered two consecutive grand mal seizures that broke my skull and nose.

I had never history of seizures, brain MRI   EEGs done last year came out clear and crystal, and this medicine lowered my threshold so much, 6 months after I stopped it I am not the same, I am not the same anymore. Please be careful and think ten times before you decide to drop it.",UNK
4025,"I&#039;ve had Implanon for 2 and a half years now. I can&#039;t wait to get it out and I will never get it again. The main reason is I have gained A LOT of weight with this, and also I feel is the cause of my acne/mood swings. My periods have now stopped completely, besides the odd month of spotting. Spotting that may last about 2 weeks, then stop for one week, then come back for another week. It definitely does it great job  as acting as a contraceptive. Handy for people who don&#039;t want to take the pill everyday.",UNK
4026,"I have been taking this BC for about 4 months, it was great until the last month when I started getting headaches, quick heartbeats, lose of sleep. I gained weight in all the right areas so that was a plus. But I can&#039;t put up with the headaches, I&#039;m tired all the time and total loss in sex drive (which is weird because I think about sex all the time).

4027,"I took Pristiq for 6 years for depression, PTSD and anxiety but wasn&#039;t getting results anymore. My Dr. Switched me to Fetzima but I had an allergic reaction.  Ultimately I ended up on Brintellix. I started on 5mg and am currently on 10mg. Although the medicine works, the GI side effects are almost intolerable. I tried bumping up to 20mg and would vomit within an hr. The current 10mg. dose causes nausea, increased acid reflux, constipation, gas and bloating. Considering switching.",UNK

But now that I&#039;m in my junior year, I&#039;m breaking out twice as much. My dermatologist prescribed me Differin (0.01 cream adapalene), and it was quite pricey because I was taking it alongside clindamycin, which I only put on my pimples whereas I used a pea-sized amount of Differin on my entire face. I&#039;m currently on my third day of Differin and Clindamycin, and I have been experiencing skin peelings on my nose and a little bit of redness and tenderness. There have been more breakouts (I now have 6 pimples), and I hope it gets worse before it gets better now that it&#039;s still holiday break.",UNK

4032,I&#039;ve been on it for about 4 months. I do get nauseous taking it. My appetite seems to have decreased but I&#039;ve gained a lot of weight on it. I do get headaches more often and for some reason I get constipated as well,UNK
4033,"I got Implanon in May last year. It&#039;s March now. Since then I&#039;ve had periods every 7 to 14 days. It&#039;s weird. I do not like Implanon and am getting it taken out finally. I also have acne, mood swings, and bloating all the time because I&#039;m constantly on my period. My sex drive has also gone way down most likely because I have chronic headaches all the time. However, that may be for a different reason, but it is one of the side effects. The nice thing about it is you don&#039;t have to worry about getting pregnant or taking pills everyday, but I can&#039;t tolerate something that affects my body so much. Some people like it however.

4036,"My first day of Nuva Ring is today. I inserted it without a problem although I was scared at first because of course I thought it would &quot;get lost&quot;. I admit, I feel tired and nauseous but that is probably because I have not been on birth control for 3 months since I was not sexually active during that time. I do hope it does not kill my sex drive. I am turning 25 in a week and am hoping that this birth control can be for me. I will post again when I have been a month with it.",UNK

4038,"Although the convenience of only once a week is fabulous, the patch made me a complete emotional mess, there is no other way to say it.  I was on the pill for 20 years with no side effects at all, so it has to be the extra estrogen.  I could not even wait out the first month before I simply had to take it off.  I suppose it may have gotten better, but I was irritable, over-sensitive, depressed, anxious and generally felt like I was going to come out of my skin. It also increased my appetite noticeably.  Within hours of taking it off, I felt more calm and more myself.",UNK
4039,"Effexor was a mixed bag for me -  it was very numbing, and the side effects (which lingered for years after I stopped taking it) were awful. I attempted suicide a few weeks after starting it, because I was still depressed but was more numbed to the guilt I would usually feel. Be careful of this, make sure someone is aware if you feel at risk. It took a few months, but I began to feel positive things again, but eventually I was stuck in a zombie state where the side effects outweighed the good. I tried it on a few occasions with the same result: taking myself off them because I wanted to feel again. The best advice I can give is to see a psychiatrist, not a GP. There is a range of medicines, make sure you get the one that is tailored to YOU.",UNK
4040,"I am 18 &amp; Kariva was the first birth control I was prescribed. Definitely does it&#039;s job birth-control wise, there was some prolonged spotting after my first period on the pill but my flow was steady after that. No weight changes, however I noticed it did nothing to help my acne, which was a factor in starting birth control. My first week on the pill, I experienced heavy nausea &amp; diarrhea, so first timers keep that in mind. The worst part about the experience in general was the mood swings. I have always been an anxious person by nature but Kariva increased my level of self-conciousness, stress, &amp; feeling of uneasiness. I also experienced some bouts of depression. All in all it could work well for some, but I have just switched my b.c. brand",UNK

I still suffer from aching legs at night, which I assume is part of the same condition.",UNK
4042,"I will start off saying that the only reason this got a 3 rating is that I realize that everyone will react differently. As a smoker over age 35, my options for birth control were limited.  My experience has been very bad. Insertion - not much pain; bruised for about 2 weeks. First 2.5-3 weeks, no bleeding. Been bleeding non-stop ever since except for one time for about 2 weeks after trying an Ibuprofen regimen recommended by my nurse. That has not helped since. Had some bad mood swings the first month and have had a minimal amount of weight gain over 6 months (3-5 lbs). Have had worse cramping than I used to have. Can&#039;t verify if it is an effective birth control as my husband won&#039;t touch me due to the bleeding. Having it removed in about 1.5 weeks.",UNK
4043,"I had a major breakdown and was put on 50mg Pristiq, increased to 100mg. I noticed an immediate improvement (on the 50mg) because it stopped the uncontrollable crying.

So, as I am no longer depressed I am coming off this medication. I reduced the dose to 1 tablet every second day for 2 weeks and this is now the 3rd week.I have now been without the tablets for 4 days and have noticed quite a lot of dizziness but no more headaches.

I also gained 15 pounds and have severe acne which to me is the worst side effect.. I have never gotten acne before this.

4045,My doctor put me on the patch because I have terrible cramps during my period and usually develop ovarian cysts that are very painful a few days before my period starts. I put this on at 7pm and by midnight I had terrible headaches to the point I couldn&#039;t lift my neck or even talk because my teeth hurt. I felt immediate pain in my pelvic area where I placed it.

I got depressed/anxious again after about another month. Just doesn&#039;t work. Never truly felt back to normal or that sense of well being.  WAY too expensive.  One positive thing is that it didn&#039;t make me feel sleepy compared to all the others (Lexapro, Celexa, Prozac).",UNK
4105,"I&#039;ve had Skyla for almost 5 months now. The procedure for getting it inserted was a bit painful. I got it inserted 7 weeks after having my third child so I didn&#039;t think it would be so bad. I felt a pinch that lasted about 10 seconds. It was quick but painful in my experience. I immediately started to spot after. I had heavy bleeding that lasted for about a month. I haven&#039;t had a period since, I have been spotting on and off though. Not sure if me breastfeeding has anything to do with it. I get a lot of nasty discharge. It must have something to do with Skyla because I had been fine before that. I check my strings constantly and at first they were very hard. My husband described them as Bobby pin type of feeling. Been having pains lately too",UNK

Doctor shortly thereafter increased my dose to 10MG. I felt happy and very, very focused. Time got away from me,  and the days blurred together. Unfortunately I experienced some negative side-effects. I noticed that I became agitated easily and even very, very angry at times.  There were times that I hated everything. Not to mention the complete loss of sex drive- very big problem at 26 years old. Back on 5mg now. Still no sex drive. Plus the meds are so expensive!",UNK

I got it inserted in September, had non-stop old blood coming out from down below from October to January. Went away until May, and since them, I&#039;ve had to wear a R sized tampon every day, and we are in July now.

It doesn&#039;t get you pregnant, but it makes me angry, sad, irritable, and I believe, extremely tired; plus, I got it so I could sleep with my boyfriend without worries, figures, now I can&#039;t even do it because of the gross bleeding.",UNK
4110,I started taking Movantik four months ago.  At first it was like a miracle.  I had a bowel movement soon after taking it in the am.  As time went on my bowel movements became days apart and I needed to supplement with senna and ducolax.  I try to eat as much fiber as possible.  I&#039;m going to try milk of magnesia.  I must say that my stools are very seldom hard and I&#039;m very happy because hard stools caused so much pain that lasted several days.  I did have gas and stomach cramps but rarely anything really unpleasant.,UNK

After 8 weeks at 40 mg I could not handle the excessive sweating that was so bad I was showering sometimes 4 times a day and washing my sheets almost daily. The worst part was the excessive pain after intercourse that would almost bring tears to my eyes from the pain. I have since been moved to another SSRI. ,UNK

I took the titration pack which gradually ups the dose until you get to 50mg twice a day. I wanted to stop after the second day. I was feeling angry, having headaches, nausea, and some vomiting... you name the symptom and I had it. For whatever reason, I pushed through and it gradually become better. I noticed after a week I was waking up with more ease than I had in 4 years and I didn&#039;t have the overwhelming fatigue I usually did. The only side effect that I still have is hot flash/sweating. Sometimes it seems unbearable but compared to the fatigue/pain I think I can handle it.",UNK
4115,"I&#039;ve had psoriasis for 15 years and I used the taclonex ointment for a couple of years before going on biologics. Last month I had a flare up while on Stelara and my derm told me taclonex had been reformulated into a suspension and he wanted me to try it and gave me a coupon for $0 copay. Yay! I take the RX to be filled and find out that my insurance will not cover it and the coupon pays up to $300 my portion was $1433. The ointment worked well for me, so I just knew the reformulated version would work wonders. I used the suspension 2x/day for a month. This medication was extremely greasy, ruined my sheets and my clothes and actually made my psoriasis worse. I would NOT recommend this product. Try clobetasol instead.",UNK

I have the worst mood swings. I am grumpy all the time. I&#039;ve gained maybe 5-10lbs. My breasts are extremely tender all the time and have gotten bigger unfortunately (I prefer small boobs). I am considering getting it taken out. I&#039;d recommend this only because it does prevent pregnancy but the side effects are terrible.,UNK

Another important thing I&#039;ve noticed is my hair gets very oily very fast after a shower. Within 3 hours after I have fixed my hair all nice, it become very oily and I find that to be a big issue for me (I cannot stand oily hair). The plus side to it, it made my skin so beautiful, I didn&#039;t have acne for the first 5 months, but I&#039;m starting to see acne starting to pop up more often and weight gain. ",UNK

I had dizziness like I was going to blackout, heart palpitations, SOB (shortness of breath), diarrhea and vomiting at the same time (sitting on toilet and holding a bucket at the same time wanting to pass out from the dehydration). Never again, I&#039;ll stick with Creomulsion.",UNK
4122,"3rd week, and I&#039;m only on 15 mg. I am very sensitive to medication. For instance, Zoloft completely zonked me and all I did was sleep. I started taking Viibryd at night, but didn&#039;t sleep for 3 nights. I switched to mornings and have had no trouble sleeping at night. I take it with a meal and have not had nausea, etc. I did have a terrible headache last night and believe the pain in my calves may be a side effect. My muscles in my calves feel like I&#039;ve run a marathon...very sore and tight. Also, I&#039;ve been unable to &quot;stop thinking&quot; and relax. Overall I think Viibryd is working much better than Zoloft did for me (my sexual side effects are much less than with Zoloft), however I plan to call my doctor about the leg pain and racing thoughts.",UNK
4123,"I had Implanon inserted in March of 2008 after my friend had it inserted and said it was fine.  The only problem I have had was irregular periods there were very irregular.  Sometimes they were short and I called it spotting, but then I would spot for about 1-2 weeks.  But then it would go away for a month and come back.  I think alot of it was stress.  Since July of this year I sort of started new with my life.  I have had two periods since July (it is November), and they were both short and more of a heavy spotting.  But its been alot better.  Overall I am happy with it, and in 2011 I will get a new one inserted, unless they come out with something better!",UNK

I have yet to have an actual period, but have spotted / bled enough every day since the insertion, with more painful cramps (daily) that I had previously on a regular. cycle. Also, I never experienced migraines in the past, and since the mirena I get them frequently (at least one biweekly) that brings nausea and effects my vision.

It did not help my cramps as much as I thought it was going to. It also made me have really bad head aches and  acne. It has been almost a week since I&#039;ve stopped taking it and my mood and acne has cleared up.

My worst enemy is MORNING COFFEE and I realized that I am smoking a few especially during that time. I am going to try to cut off coffee especially in the morning time. About side effects I worried a lot before when I started with medications,  but so far NONE.

But the pain and nausea I felt last night for hours almost sent me to the ER. I kept wishing I could go ahead and vomit so that I&#039;d feel better, but I never could.

I would wake up in the middle of the night yelling about how bad my feet hurt, because they woke me up. I had trouble touching things and picking things up because of the pins and needles in my hands (and occasionally still do).

But the negative is, I gained 20+ pounds, I get sharp pains in my abdomen, I also get pains where it was implanted, I have no sex drive anymore, headaches and feeling nauseous.

The pro is that Liletta was very effective in avoiding pregnancy and it got rid of my period. The con is that I experienced frequent painful headaches, cramping before my periods (which is new to me), painful sex from sharp ovary pain and dryness, low libido, acne, weight gain, and serious bloating.

I HAVE experienced two seizures thought to be caused by Tramadol while I was titrating upward on the drug, but have had no problems since.  I have tried titrating off of Tramadol twice and in both instances experienced moderate withdrawal symptoms of the opiate type almost immediately.

4217,My doctor prescribed 0.5 mg which I take half a tablet going to bed if that doesn&#039;t work I take the other half. Depends on how much sleep I need or how much anxiety I have. If I&#039;m exhausted the medicine is great  I fall asleep and next thing I know I&#039;m awake in the morning but it usually leaves a hangover which I hate. I try to deal with my anxiety holisticly but  sometimes that does not work. I think it all comes down to eating healthy and watching my sugar and carb and caffeine intake. Walking and doing stretches works for me but honestly  Having someone who really loves you and does not abuse you in anyway is the best answer but I don&#039;t think there&#039;s many people out there like that anymore.   Koliopin is a horrible dangerous drug.   All pharmaceuticals as far as I&#039;m concerned are bad for us and then least we take it the better off we are.,UNK

Sadly I am an asthmatic - the multiple respiratory infections and the persistent coughing was too much - Oddly My pulmonologist read up on the drug and it has been used to treat respiratory conditions but it triggered my asthma -   Psoriasis went away !!! Skin looked amazing !!  Some diarrhea- but would have sacrificed that for the amazing results - wish there was an alternative,UNK

I was medically dependent within months.  In late fall 09, the medicines just lost their effect by at least 50%.  So I was faced with a 50% increase in medicines.  I said NO!  So I tried a medical detox place to start.  After 90 hours there, they said you have done great we are sending you home.  I was so proud till 4a.m. the next day. I threw up 90 times in the next 60 hours.  I lost 34lbs. in 8 days and had severe withdrawal symptoms for 2 more weeks.

It was so bad it continued after I was off of it for 6 months.  I had to see a GI dr because I thought I had IBS.  This pill caused me to be nauseous, have acid reflux and zapped my sex drive.  It caused vaginal dryness too.  I would also get terrible migraines and I NEVER get migraines or headaches.  I ended up going off of it because my body couldn&#039;t handle the side effects.   Made me slightly melancholy and tired too.

However have found if I take pill packets back to back I always get breakthrough bleeding, which I haven&#039;t had with previous pills. Boobs have become more sensitive and got bigger, which I don&#039;t mind! But it&#039;s also meant I&#039;ve put on almost a stone in 4 months without my lifestyle changing (I eat healthily, exercise regularly, have always had a good metabolism).

Cons: I have had this implant since Feb 2015. It has barely been 5 months and so far I have gained 20 pounds! The weight gain is terrible and I am worried that I will keep gaining weight even though I eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly. Sometimes the implant makes my arm very sore. About the time I would normally have a period each month, I get bloated, cramp and get very moody, the symptoms I associate with a period, but have no bleeding or spotting.

So I switched to taking it before bed and I would wake up every night with dizzy spells and heart beating out my chest. It would take a hour for those symptoms to go away and for me to continue my sleep.

4239,Xanax is a medication that must be taken seriously and with precaution. This is not a game. Taking it when you don&#039;t need to will only create addiction and the withdrawal is worse than living with the actual anxiety. Please don&#039;t take this med unless you suffer from anxiety and you are having a panic attack. It works well in these situations but my advice is to stay away from it and only take it in an emergency. I prefer lorazepam. When you take lorazepam the withdrawal symptoms are more tolerable than xanax. Xanax is awesome but it can become Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. You can die from this or get a DUI if you are caught in a driving accident. This is serious.,UNK

I just started tri-previfem yesterday so I hope I can get my sex drive back!",UNK

I happen to delay for more than two weeks with my picking up that refill but experienced no discerning effects with my sudden stopping or upon renewing the daily dosage.",UNK

Unfortunately, a fall in August alerted my doctor to my bones being weakened. Also, I have optic neuritis in my left eye starting in July. Between those two side effects, we&#039;ve decided to taper off the trileptal and return to lithium. I&#039;m sad to stop it but the soft bones and eye issues are too great a problem to continue it.",UNK

I&#039;ve never had a problem with my skin but over the last 3 months I haven&#039;t gone a day without a pimple on my face, and my back and chest are not okay.  I feel so gross.  I do so much to take care of myself and after looking at my daily life, the only thing I can attribute these things to is my pill.  It is also the only medication I take.",UNK
4276,So it came back a LOT since last posting. I have had to figure everything out myself.  It was hormone related big time ! Got on nuvaring birth control for 3 or 4 months recently and have come off the last month. That helped more than anything. Reset your hormone Balance with birth control.  Also BV has a hard time living when you take birth controls.,UNK

I didn&#039;t notice any side effects the first day I took it, but the second time I felt very nauseous and had a headache. For the next two weeks, I experienced nausea, moodiness, headaches and other uncomfortable symptoms. After a week, I had withdrawal bleeding.

However, after 30 days the effects started to wane and, after 90 days, I feel little benefit.  I tried taking an additional 3rd supplemental dose of 100mg a couple of hours after my second daily dose of 200mg to see if the good results might return, but all I gained from the additional 100mg was a headache.  There is a definite and very unfortunate tolerance problem with Provigil in my experience.",UNK

From the start I have had some nausea but nothing I couldn&#039;t handle and I can&#039;t eat as much as I always seem full so I am starting to lose weight already so that is a positive. The negatives are that my levels are too high and this is causing my vision to be blurry and it is making it difficult for me to drive also in the morning I feel really lethargic which makes it difficult to concentrate at work. I have also noticed my skin feels dry especially my lips . I am due to go back to my specialist after 4 weeks but I am not sure if I will continue.

At 1:30 I woke up in pain and went to the bathroom. Seemed to be nothing but gas-the worst possible gas you could ever have trapped inside you! I actually thought I was dying and wanted to call 911. Thirty minutes of this then I finally pooped. Not much, soft but formed. Back to bed, an hour later the diarrhea started. It&#039;s 5am and it hasn&#039;t stopped. Explosive watery smelly awful stuff. Felt like hot lava. Do not give this to children. Or adults. Never ever take these. I&#039;m throwing them out! I gave it a 2 because it technically works. I actually lost 2 pounds (so far) :(",UNK

The rash got bigger over a two month period while I was taking the pill, make up couldn&#039;t even disguise it and it was sometimes itchy... using ointment but nothing worked. Stopped taking the pill a little less than 2 wks ago while I continued using my ointments. The rash is 95% better already.

I have tried most if not all the Adhd meds. None of them seem to really help me pay attention much. They are somewhat helpful more for wakefulness. Phetermine although seriously dangers worked the best. I&#039;d say vyvanse second best, However compared to Adderall XR 20mg twice a day I&#039;d say is very similar effect if not better than vyvanse 70mg and it&#039;s more convenient to be able to split up two tabs when you need to space dosses apart or save for rainy day. I rated a 6 stars based on what I&#039;d like it to do compared to what it does for me. I have pretty high tolerances in general",UNK

I was in a lot of pain so they gave me &quot;a lot&quot; of medicine according to the nurse so they could finish the colonoscopy. I was very groggy and when I went to stand up the back of my legs cramped up and I almost fell over.

My normal weight is 170-180lbs. I&#039;m currently at 250lbs. Nothing has changed in eating or exercise habits but I&#039;m still gaining weight like crazy.

I have been to a therapist because of how emotional I&#039;ve been and I have wanted to drop out of college.

I didn&#039;t like the look I would get from family and friends who saw me taking my medicine and wondering was I abusing it or not. I am doing this for me, my family and friends. I am just scared that I would relapse and that at some point Suboxone won&#039;t work. But it has only been 3 days and the drowsiness is horrible and interferes with my daily activities.

Just for the quality of the erection and speed to start working, I prefer V to C.",UNK

The pain is on the outside &quot;lady bit&quot; region too. So far this is the only side effect for me. My sex drive is the same, still waiting for acne control, and I haven&#039;t experienced increased discharge. I&#039;m on my first month and only have been on it for two weeks.

For the last 4 weeks is been a constant light flow. My normal cycle usually lasted no longer than 5 days varying from light to heavy to light.

4307,"I had the implant in my arm for about 10 months. The only reason why I never got pregnant was because my period lasted for 4-6 weeks. Which was the worst side effect.

Before getting the implant, I was a nice 140 pounds and then I went to 165 in about 2 months. I&#039;m a professional dancer and I&#039;m in the gym 5 times a week and I eat extremely healthy.

My mood seems better, my skin and energy felt good but as soon as I added that 3rd pill things changed. Waves of nausea, my eyesight has been horrible, light effects my eyes differently and my vision has been unsteady which it adds to the nausea. I&#039;m supposed to start taking 4 today and to be honest I&#039;m really not sure I want to keep going.

I never understood depression caused by the pill because I never experienced it but this pill literally made my life hell. I was so moody, crying at the smallest things, and my sex drive was GONE.

4334,I don&#039;t know what to do. I just started taking Bryaz a little less than 2 weeks ago. And already I wanna cry when I wanna hear sad music or music for reminiscing. I am tired all the time.  I have some trouble sleeping and did get nightmares a few times. I have the PCOS and Endometriosis. But I am missing my sanity. My Dr. prescribed me Beyaz for 6mo. And I am to skip the sugar pills which I read can be deadly.,UNK
4335,"My doctor started me on Yaz about a month and half ago for my PMDD disorder. I do not have the weight gain that I would get every month 10 days before my period and mood swings and the overwhelming feeling of unattractiveness 10 days before my period went away, one side effect that was odd was insomnia and only one panic attack. I&#039;m not sure if the insomnia or panic attack is related to Yaz because I had both 3 to 4 years ago but it went away. I am 35 years old and have never used the pill before taking Yaz.",UNK

4338,"I started Taytulla during the last few days of December 2016. I had no problems--no fatigue, no stomach ache, no headaches, just basically nothing out of the ordinary. Within the first couple of months, I had mild spotting, and the side effects of my period did not go away. I still had terrible cramps, stomach bloating, and my acne actually seemed to get worse as the months went on. 6 months later, I am seeing no difference in anything EXCEPT! My period DOES come at the right time at the end of my packet every month. The real issue? EXPENSIVE!!! With insurance only covering part of the cost (Original price is almost $200, it costs $80 a month. Who has that kind of money??",UNK

It took me about a week to get used to all the side effects but when you realize how much weight you are losing the side effects aren&#039;t even in your mind anymore, I started taking Adipex Jan 24th 2014. Weighing 210 pounds. Today is now Feb 19th not even a month later and I now weigh 185. That is 25 pounds down in just one month.  I work out (run a mile, ellipitical, 20 min abs) 5 to 6 days a week and I only eat 1000 to 1300 calories a day! This pill is amazing and everyone needs to try it, that is wanting to lose weight.",UNK

However, I have gained weight, have trouble sleeping (never had that issue in my life!), and feel like scratching my skin off everywhere I affix the patch. No matter how dry my skin is, this large, thick, ugly patch has trouble sticking and moisture always gets under it. I end up with an angry itchy red ring that lasts for a week after its gone. So I&#039;m switching to name brand Vivelle Dot. I hope to get the same benefits with a smaller, less ugly patch, and hope it resolves the irritation!",UNK

I rarely had cramps before I got it,  but since then I get pretty bad ones every few months. I broke out horribly from July-Dec, and it only got better because I took medication for my skin. The acne left dark purple marks on my cheeks, that are just barely disappearing. I gained about 10-15 lbs, but after about a year my body dropped back down to what I weighed before. It has prevented pregnancy, sex drive is about the same. After that year mark things were going great until about four months ago. Apparently my uterus lining has been getting worn down by the IUD. Bleeding for months straight. Every day.",UNK

4349,I&#039;ve been on the nuvaring for about 4 months now and I absolutely hate it. The only reason I have continued to use it is because I don&#039;t have a period while taking it. This BC gives me the most extreme mood swings I have ever experienced. I can be happy one minute then be mad/depressed the next. This has caused me to have relationships to fail in my life. I absolutely hate it and I would never recommend this to anyone!,UNK

It smells and tastes like it&#039;s something you&#039;d use for car repairs. That&#039;s how bad it is. After the 1st gallon, it starts to get harder to drink every 15 min. and keep it down and not vomit it up.

I am dizzy all the time, feel like the room is spinning.  Pharmacist said this could last up to 3 months.  I went off of it very slowly!  I have been without it for about a month now.  I have never been an addict of any kind, but I feel like one with this.  I know that taking more will make these side effects go away, and I think about this pill all day every day.

I wanted to start taking the pill before the school year to see how it would impact me and to get adjusted. At first, my acne flared up more than usual. Once I got my period, I experienced horrid and uncomfortable cramps one of the first days, that I had to call out of work for being sick (I was crawling, crying and threw up once). The period lasted about 2 weeks. I&#039;ve had slightly bipolar moods before but once taking this pill, the moods were extremely hot and cold. For two hours I would be angry and then I would experience happiness for a bit, just to go into another anger/sadness. Depression was worse with bad thoughts. I&#039;m stopping the pill now.",UNK

It&#039;s not a full scale period but heavy spotting enough to fill a few panty liners a day or a thin pad.

Yes I will say that it is effective but I would only recommend it if you don&#039;t plan to have sex. For a while, right after I had sex I would get my period and it would be super heavy which was nothing I ever experienced.

Sore breasts- this started immediately. So bad that I would take ibuprofen and sleep with a hot rag on them. I could barely move sometimes without horrible swollen breast pain. Has stopped somewhat lately. 

Nausea- After having the nexplanon in for about 6 months nausea began as a PMS symptom. I would be driving &amp;have to pull over to throw up.

One of the main causes of hormonal acne is a rise is androgens (male hormones) which you do NOT need more of if you are experiencing hormonal acne (jawline, chin, cystic). I did not realize that Alesse had added androgens and went on it for just short of a month. Needless to say my face, back and chest area have broken out worse than being off birth control altogether.

Maybe there was some slight mood stabilization, but not enough for me to really feel relief.  I was taken off of it for this reason.  Also, even at 5 mg, it caused me some restlessness and a sensation similar to a headache.  It&#039;s expensive too.",UNK

After reading these reviews, I&#039;m going to self de-medicate for a spell to see if my sleep pattern changes as well as other possible side effects I&#039;ve listed.

So, I stopped Lunesta for one month and went on 15, and then 20 mg of Belsomra. As best I can describe it, the Beslomra was interesting. Interesting, in that when I could fall asleep, it did feel much more natural. I would also wake up in the morning feeling tired and just wanting to lay in bed and relax. That is not a bad thing. However, it simply would not put me to sleep on most nights. Moreover, the tiredness feeling I experienced tended to linger all day. It was not a drugged feeling, but just a tiredness I could not shake.  So, I went back to Lunesta.  Not perfect, but does it&#039;s job well!",UNK

I stayed on the med because it was fully covered, whereas Yaz costs a significant amount more.  Recently I switched back to Yaz and couldn&#039;t be feeling better.

I bloated out and looked like 6 months pregnant. So I got off all birth control for one month and inserted the NuvaRing when my period started. I have been constantly nauseous with no appetite at all. I also have SEVERE diarrhea. I&#039;m still going to give it a try for another month to see if those side effects wear off.

4422,"MY EXPERIENCE with Effexor XR vs Prozac

1) EXR eliminates ALL PANIC ATTACKS
2) Prozac eliminates ALL OBSESSIVE THINKING
3) Prozac made me sleep like a fat cat even tho I RARELY ate, and I gained a ton of weight when I was only 106 lbs to start.
4) EXR did not cause me weight gain (or loss) however it made me very irritable and I caught myself clenching my jaw all day, however had a lot more energy than Prozac.
5) BOTH meds I used over 12 weeks to make a fair comparison.

6) I saw a bio-identical hormones therapist to see what&#039;s going on.  No clear cut answers.  So here is my thought.  You&#039;re a normal person being a normal life with a normal energy level. You take Prozac and Wham! You&#039;re  sleeping 10 hours a day.............................",UNK

It is tedious and cumbersome, it is given intravenously over 24 hours and that in itself is a major disadvantage. It requires a pump that feeds the medicine all day all night. The pouches that contain the medicine must be replaced every night and a spare must be carried on the patient at all times. They must be kept on ice to retain the effectiveness of the medicine.

It did seem to help at school for focus, but he had extreme rage issues.  It got so bad that we called the police to find out what our options were if he were to actually hurt us or his little sister.  He never hurt us, but did break a window, the screen door, and throw objects.

I was bleeding for 5 months and went to the doctors and they said I was anemic and gave me a hormone medicine to stop the bleeding I was still bleeding. Maybe around the 6 or 7 month I stopped and just gained a massive amount of weight I was 170 and went all the way to 250 while I was playing sports and working out. I finally got off and they told me it could be in my system for up to a year while I&#039;m still trying to lose weight. I DON&#039;T RECOMMEND,UNK

I wasn&#039;t expecting to have to go all night so that was jarring.  Followed all of the doctor&#039;s instructions to a t because who wants to go through this again anytime soon.  Ten years ago the prep lasted longer so I thought starting the prep at 5 was an improvement, but anyone who can figure out how to deliver this efficient of a bowel prep with a pill and avoid having to down nasty tasting stuff like this should earn the appreciation of all of us and the Nobel prize in medecine.

4518,My experience with my first month of using Chateal has been eventful. I feel a little less stress in the getting not getting pregnant aspect of taking a birth control however the sideffects have been testing. I&#039;m almost always feeling nauseous or bloaty and I can tell I&#039;ve gained a lot of weight. I have had crazy mood swings which has caused some issues between my boyfriend and me. I was out to eat with some friends and I literally wanted to simultaneously punch a wall laugh and cry all at once. I feel my depression is growing stronger but I am taking preemptive strikes to keeping that controlled. Yes i would suggest this pill. However Chateal may not be for everyone.,UNK

High fever, kidney infection with blood in the urine, extremely high PSA (from 0.5 to 13.3), elevated liver labs, positive/reactive for hepatitis B (after several labs, it was confirmed that it was negative), insomnia, total fatigue, etc. And the list continues, again this all happened within (3) weeks. After (2) rounds of antibiotics (PSA dropped down to 2.5), x-rays, cat scans, bladder/kidney tests confirmed that there was nothing wrong with my prostate, kidney or liver. Even after my experience I&#039;m happy so many of you have wonderful results! Good luck to all.",UNK

I completely shut out the outside and withdrew from 90% of everything I liked. I read all of the reviews about the medicine as far a getting off of it, and I felt that it was pushing me further into a hole.

Zoloft negatives: constant yawning, first three days you feel so unwell you think you&#039;ll never be ok again.  Also, inability to have an orgasm, which lasted about three months and then I was fine. Serious vertigo that got so bad I had to stop taking it. 
Tried venlafaxine and Prozac with better results.",UNK
4575,"I&#039;m 17 and have been taking 18mg Concerta every day for a week and a half. This is the second medication I&#039;ve tried after being diagnosed with ADHD (I was also diagnosed with major depression). First I tried Adderall, and while it made me feel very alert and productive, I could not handle the severe depressed feelings from the comedown. So far Concerta has made me feel productive and positive for about 3 hours, and then depression slowly creeps in and gets progressively worse for about 8 more hours. It&#039;s not as intense as the depression from Adderall (which even led to suicidal thoughts), but it lasts longer. I also become irritable, anxious, and tired. I&#039;ve also lost weight because trying to eat makes me feel queasy.",UNK
4576,"I took this birth control about 6 months and I am very moody and I cry over everything that happens to me. I get headaches very easily after I started to take this pills. Everytime I had sex, it wasn&#039;t as good as it used to be, and now I&#039;ve been off for over a month now, and I am not moody, but I have one of the side effect of quitting birth control which is I haven&#039;t got period. I am very nervous about this as well.",UNK
4577,"I have taken my first dosage and my BMs have lasted five hours since I started it (so far) and by now everything is clear. I do NOT understand how they give the same dosage of two bottles to everyone. I am 20, 5&#039;5 and 115. How can someone much larger than me take the same dose? Am considering not taking second.",UNK
4578,I used this  for like 2 weeks  I must say it really  worked.  I had watery and very itchy eyes. It worked on me  immediately . But the worst thing is this drug makes me so sleepy and drowsy.  And  I hate that.,UNK
4579,"Treated for a UTI, was given a 7 day dose to take twice a day. After two/three days it cleared but still could feel a slight infection, it ran me down completely and I developed a YEAST INFECTION with itching and redness .

4580,"I was diagnosed with ET 6 weeks ago. I was prescribed Primidone. To date, I still am having serious side effects. My tremors are continual, even to the point where my left arm feels &quot;dead&quot;. Generally I feel drained, dizzy, and sick to my stomach. My voice is halting, with shaky patterns, and is more affected when I am tired. I find it very difficult to take this medicine and will be calling my Doctor to discuss any other options.",UNK
4581,"I&#039;ve been on Gianvi for 3 months. I feel like a crazy person. My emotions are through the roof and I get random spurts of horrible anger and irritation. The first two months I didn&#039;t notice much, it all came at once. My breasts are almost unbearably sore, and it has done nothing for my horrible heavy period and painful cramps. I feel like I&#039;m PMSing constantly. It&#039;s just not working for me. Hopefully others have had a better experience than I. I can&#039;t wait to switch to something new.",UNK
4582,"I felt very nauseous the whole time, and suffered from a hyper sensitivity to smells which only compounded the problem. It happened from the very first day that I took the birth control and lasted a few days after I quit.",UNK
4583,"I never have side effects from medicines so I foolishly took Nuvigil without reading the literature. Couldn&#039;t figure out where the headaches, fever and general feeling of &#039;being sick&#039; came from.  Palpitations, the tingling in extremities, feeling as though my mind was always two steps ahead of my reactions...just too much.  I feel fortunate nothing worse happened.",UNK
4584,"I have migraines really bad, my neurologist prescirbed Stadol as a last resort medication.  So far it has not worked.  Just made me nauseated and gave me a head rush.  It&#039;s very discouraging to read the comments about ER&#039;s thinking migraine sufferers are drug seeking people.  It&#039;s sad that we get no attention or help.  I would rather suffer than go to the ER and be put in a group that I&#039;m not in.  Good luck to all of us :)",UNK
4585,"I have had the Skyla IUD for a full year now. When I first had it inserted, I basically felt very extreme sharp cramps. I became very nauseous and had to wait at the doctors office before returning home. I was in a lot of pain and the rest of the day I just felt sore. The pain continued for about 3 weeks so I had to take a lot of ibuprofen. After awhile, the pain was less frequent but I experienced somewhat heavy spotting for months. Eventually the pain and the bleeding was less frequent, only occurring when it was my period. However the spotting is quite consistent (even still) and when it&#039;s not spotting I have a brownish discharge. Basically, I always have to wear a liner or light tampon. And I occasionally experience cramping still.",UNK
4586,"I&#039;m 19 and taking MoviPrep for my first colonoscopy. Or should I say WAS taking it. First glass was terrible but with a plugged nose and a strong chaser, it was possible. The second glass was absolutely horrible. About halfway through it I vomited twice, got the chills and called my Doctor to cancel. I&#039;m rescheduled with a different prep (with only 4 total tablespoons of prep and a ton of water!) The rest of the day my stomach was upset and came close to vomiting multiple times. It&#039;s now 12 (did the half a liter at 5) and the bowels just started moving. Would not recommend, it&#039;s terrible and there are better alternatives!",UNK
4587,"I am a 23 year old male suffering from occasional (about once a month) migraine attacks which are often accompanied with uncontrollable vomiting. My neurologist prescribed me this medicine saying that it is the most advanced one currently available and made specifically for migraines. Unfortunately, after taking the medicine several times during various attacks, It had about as much effect as an Aspirin and it stop the pain or the nausea.

My mother, who suffers from more often and severe migraines then I do, got prescribed the same medicine, but it didn&#039;t help her either. I ended up switching to Ketoprofen based painkillers which have been most effective for me, but don&#039;t work during the worst attacks.",UNK
4588,"Me again. 5 months later on Subutex. I now need two 2mg and my tramadol.
I still have pain. It seems my back condition has become worse. (MRI shows no bone problems) Strange as for a few weeks it was better and I needed less pain relief. I&#039;m upset by this pain and I&#039;m on Gabapentin and benzo&#039;s on top of this lot. This just slows down my breathing and makes me drunk. Still, I&#039;m in severe pain. I do not know what to do now. ",UNK
4589,"Suffered with ED for years.  Had slowly gotten worse to the point of zero erections.  My Urologist prescribed Cialis.  The first time I tried it results were poor a few flacid short lived erections.  I called my doctor and he said try again as it might not work the first time.  The second time was fantastic.  The second time almost as good as the first.  The third time poor results only one erection capable of intercourse.  The fourth time even worse, fifth time nothing at all.  Switched to Viagra on Dr.s suggestion.  Cialis side effects were moderate headache, moderate back ache, stuffiness and sinus pressure.",UNK
4590,"I have been on depo for a year and 3 months and have had no issue until now. It worked perfectly after I had my laparoscopy when I was diagnosed with stage I endometriosis. Now after this past month I&#039;ve had bleeding and I have had 4 flare ups.... more than I had before my laparoscopy had been done. Went to the doctor with severe abdominal pain, nonstop bleeding and he had to take every gynecological test your mind can come up with, all of them came back negative. Doc is suggesting I go onto Lupron with add-back therapy since it&#039;s a lot stronger. Didn&#039;t have any side effects with the depo at all. I just hope with my new medicine administration of Lupron on the 24th of this month I will feel some much needed relief",UNK
4591,"I took diflucan first, per call to Dr. Then I went for an exam. The dr. said that diflucan only helps if the yeast is in the gut.  He prescribed Terizol 3-day.  After using the medication I still feel uncomfortable and not itchy.  What is going on?",UNK
4592,"First of all, not all doctors are trained in how to properly insert Nexplanon. The wrong doctor may embed it too deep, causing a 20-30 minute removal. Make sure the doctor has done is at least 20-30 times. The only pro of this BC is that its the most effective BC out there and you don&#039;t have to consciously think about it. Nexaplanon made gain weight, bleed for a month at a time, cost me hundreds of dollars in tampons &amp; pads, caused a yeast infection and completely changed by personality (caused depression and horrible anger spells), it affected my relationships with everyone I know. Just had it removed last week, emotionally I feel like myself again, however horrible cramps &amp; morning sickness have been present.",UNK
4593,"I definitely can&#039;t say my experience with Mirena has been anything but crappy. The initial insertion of the IUD wasn&#039;t as bad as I imagined, didn&#039;t take more then 20 minutes. I was crampy for about a day and was already bleeding as I was on my period so I wouldn&#039;t have known the difference from spotting and my period. But its been over 4 months now n I&#039;m still spotting. Mainly that brown end of the period kind of junk, can&#039;t really tell whats my actual period anymore. I do lighty bleed for a few days then it&#039;ll just go back to that brown spotting. Doctor said 3 months for spotting but the actual Mirena site said up to 6 months so well see here in a month or so. I don&#039;t know how much longer I&#039;ll keep it after 6 months..a year seems unlikely.",UNK
4594,"I was always tired and lethargic. I thought it was from the chemo I was taking but when I switched to Anzemet, I realized it was the Compazine that made me tired.",UNK
4595,"It&#039;s effective in the sense that it has done it&#039;s job well, it prevented pregnancy but I absolutely hate it. I switched over from Try Cyclen due to it&#039;s cost but honestly, I&#039;m planning on switching back. Severe cramps, headaches, and mood swings galore. The worst part of it all? I have been in my period for THREE WEEKS. It&#039;s ridiculous, I&#039;ve never had issues with any other birth control. My regular period usually lasted 4 days maximum, compare that to constant bleeding for almost a month now. No thanks. Do not recommend this for anyone.",UNK
4596,"I am a 50 year old male and pre-Axiron, testosterone tested out at 323 in the morning.  I was feeling tired, sluggish, no sex drive and falling asleep in the early evening.  I started using 60 mg a day of Axiron.  I noticed a huge increase in energy and increased libido during the first two days.  Day three I could feel the effects of Axiron tapering off and I returned to feeling tired and sluggish.  After one month of using Axiron, a morning test of my testosterone tested out at 257.  Axiron dosage was just increased to 90 mg a day.  I am not sure why Axiron would work initially and then stop working.  I will give the 90 mg a day of Axiron a try for another month and have my testosterone re-tested.",UNK
4597,I have been taking these pills for abnormal cycles.  I&#039;ve had an ultrasound and a biopsy and doctors couldn&#039;t find anything.  Have to take 3 pills a day just to slow up bleeding.  Has anyone else had this problem if so did they finally get some relief.,UNK

4599,I&#039;ve been on this Heather daily pill for one month and a half and I&#039;m not really liking it. I&#039;ve been getting my period EVERY week for 3 days. And it&#039;s even worse that it starts on Thursdays which means I&#039;m on it over the weekend.

4600,"Your body will either love or hate the Implanon. I had the Implanon for one and a half years, and for me it was bad. I gained 5kgs, and would go through these cycles - two weeks on, two weeks off - of non-stop bleeding, mood swings that nearby altered my personality, and a huge increase in anxiety. I actually thought I was mentally unwell, and my doctor was so reluctant to take it out, over and over again convincing me to keep it in. But then I insisted on switching to Yaz, which worked beautifully with my body- I am myself again, losing weight was easier (I&#039;m back to my usual weight) and my cycle is back to normal. ",UNK

My skin is so dry, red, burning, and now I have so many pimples. I never have pimples. My dermatologist said this would make my skin worse but I&#039;m starting to wonder if this is worth it. My skin is disgusting. The other reviews say to keep using it and it will get better. I&#039;ll keep updating.",UNK
4602,"I started taking Zoloft 50mg for 2 days now and really felt no change yet. My Doctor said it could take up to 6 weeks to get the full effect. Think I had an anxiety attack the other day at work. Blood pressure was up, nervous, sweating, throwing up.  ",UNK

4604,"Been on the pill for 20 yrs and over the past few years have noticed more nausea.  This plus often forgetting it made me inquire into alternatives.  My Ob suggested the ring which sounded great. Am heading into my 3rd week already decided to go back to the pill.  First, it was unsettling getting it in and I felt it constantly. To not feel it requires it going pretty far in which makes it hard to find. There is also: discharge, acne, nausea and stomach cramping/bloating.  I feel like I&#039;m on my period all the time and the acne (like a kid). I think it&#039;s a good fit for some, just not for me.",UNK
4605,"I have been using this for a couple of months and have been able to start a wave of exercise that I have never been able to before.  I can run without my body seizing up and punishing me.  As this is relatively new as an option for me, I will continue to use it although I have found that my ankles are regularly puffy and i get more visual migraines.  Still do not know if this is actually connected to the use of Mexiletine though.",UNK

After a while I stopped using it as my skin was fine, when my acne came back I began to use it again after about two weeks. The morning after applying it my skin came out in large red blotches around affected areas, and it burned, was extremely itchy and it was dry. I have tried to using it now again since a month of not using it again and the same has happened, won&rsquo;t be using this product again.",UNK

4610,Just had my second injection of Bydureon. First one went fine-just little bits of nausea. The second one was two days ago. Last night I woke up sick as a dog with horrible vomiting and diarrhea. I&#039;ve been ill for hours and am now missing work. That makes me unhappy.  Guessing it&#039;s the Bydureon but maybe stomach virus. Will check in with my dr today. Byetta I could not tolerate at all. I&#039;m wondering if this one is the same.,UNK
4611,I am a nurse. I was already on wellbutrin SR-150mg 2x daily.  I concur with the dieter below. Have your Dr prescribe these meds separately.  No side effects.  The dose of naltrexone is way too high in contrave  (just my personal. .not professional opinion!) 4-5 mg of naltrexone 1-2 times a day is plenty.  Naltrexone will only work if you truly have a binge type actual food addiction.  It works on the reward center of our brains just like that of drug addicts and alcoholics. The grandiose feeling we get when we eat and all is suddenly right with the world. It turns that off for us. (And..prescribing this way? Super cheap! :),UNK
4612,"This drug is terrible.  I am a 13 year old girl and I was put on Guanfacine to treat ADHD (combined).  I started on 1MG and for the first 3 weeks it was great and then all of a sudden, I started to lose energy at 3:00pm.  I would miss out on softball practice because I was so tired.  To fix this, they decided to put me on 2MG.  It worked for a week but then I became really irritable.  Then, I would start getting extremely tired in the afternoon and it was worse than before.  I have schizophrenia as well, so of course I start having hallucinations.",UNK
4613,This is horrible. I switch from another birth control to hopefully fix my arousal issues. I&#039;ve been on it for 2 months and my period 80% of the time. I&#039;ll have my period for 9 days then no period 3-4 days and then have my period for 9 days again. It&#039;s been aweful. I also have horrible cramps now and I never use to have them.

4614,"Well I just started the medication two days ago so I can&#039;t really say yet. But I can say the first day of taking it, I had the worst headache . But today, I haven&#039;t had a headache (knock on wood) I just hope this works, it&#039;s a struggle to shed pounds. I really just need a Jump start. I&#039;m curious what time do you guys take the second pill? Is it 12 hours apart? I will report again soon",UNK
4615,"I was on this medication for about a year and never felt like it ever did anything other than make me irritable and kill my sex drive. It was extremely hard to wean off the 75mg dose which is a comparatively low dose. All up it took me about 6 months to come off it completely and the withdrawal effects after missing a dose would begin within just a few hours (brain zaps, twitchy etc). What I&#039;m amazed about is the fact the doctor who put me on it initially didn&#039;t tell me any of the side effects and didn&#039;t warn me how hard it was to come off. I realise it probably works for some people but as a dispensary tech I see people coming in who are taking 300mg of this stuff a day. I shudder to think how hard it will be for them to stop this drug.",UNK
4616,"I have had both depression and pain for the past 20 years.  After having some rather intensive back surgery 18 months ago, I decided to switch to Cymbalta instead of the Prozac that I&#039;d been taking for many years to see if it would aid in the pain.  My initial result was hot sweats, but no other help.  I missed a day while I was on 60 mg and had vertigo and an electric twinging in my brain that actually made my vision jerk.  It went away about an hour after I took my Cymbalta.  This has since recurred every time I try to wean.  I cannot get down past 30 mg.",UNK
4617,"Was on chateal for around 3 years. Everything started off fine, my acne cleared up, my periods were lightened and I never got pregnant. Around the end of the 3rd year however, things started to go down hill. My mental health was unstable (even my boyfriend noticed a dramatic change) and my sex drive seemed to diminish. I never felt like I gained a bunch of weight though and that made me happy and so I never really felt the need to change my bc. Just recently I started getting my bc through Walgreens and for some reason they prescribed me Levora. Since I switched I feel like my old self (even my boyfriend noticed the change again) so I&#039;m really happy I was basically forced to switch bc pills. Chateal is not my favorite!!!",UNK

I love having my menstrual cycle every three months. However, I have gained thirty pounds since April. I eat right and exercise an still nothing is helping. I am convinced that its the BC.

4621,"I originally started talking this BC (having never before taken any others) as an attempt to regulate my acne. It did help the acne on my back and chest a bit, but I did not notice it help clear up my face. So it was disappointing in that regard. HOWEVER I love how it regulates my period nicely with very few--if any--side effects. No nausea, no cramps, etc. BUT to be fair, I never experienced those during my normal periods.  I guess if you&#039;re just looking for a birth control pill that regulates irregular/heavy periods (mine went from 7 down to 4 days), this could be a pill for you to consider.",UNK

Spotting started and after sex it would get worst. 
It kept going through the whole period and ovulation, till about a week ago when it stopped. 
Today I&#039;m due for my next period. Don&#039;t know if it&#039;ll started again or if I&#039;m good or not.

The taste is rancid, it almost has a weird/nasty feeling in your mouth, too.  But my symptoms seem to have cleared up, I didn&#039;t finish the full 7 day dose, per my Dr since symptoms cleared and nausea was so bad, I was advised I could stop with only 2 doses left.  I will never take this antibiotic again, it feels awful being nauseas, never mind that severly and for that length of time!  Gel for me next time, if needed!",UNK

Right now I have not taken it for two days because I forgot it before I went out of town. I am tired, got insomnia and I feel like I am hung over and nauseous.
The withdrawals from taking this medication is awful. So I think anyone that wants to start this med should seriously consider this when making a decision to ingest this.
I am not the only one who has experienced this. There is a lot about withdrawing from this med on the net.",UNK

Although Solodyn reduced the amount of &#039;new&#039; acne that I got, and some of the cysts did end up rising to heads and disappeared (albeit slowly), the results weren&#039;t as dramatic as I hoped. I was still getting a fair amount of acne (maybe 50% as prior to the medicine after 4 weeks).

When I first took it the medication started to work right away, but the medication for some reason stop working after about two weeks. My anxiety came back and so did my depression. So I called my doctor and she switched me to 150MG. I thought to myself &quot;maybe the dosage was just low&quot;. Again the medication worked right away, but again the medication for some reason only lasted about two weeks. I went back to my doctor and she switched me to Prozac and so far it has worked pretty well. The symptoms I had with bupropion was nausea, diarrhea, and drowsiness.

By midway through the day I went to the park with my nephews, I took them on the swings. I thought I&#039;d go on with them, so I started swinging and it felt like I was going to die. The most terrible feeling of fear I have ever experienced. It felt like I was free falling. I had a total panic attack. At the end of it I freaked out and just needed to get home. Could barely drive or focus. By day two I started feeling terrible raw feeling in my stomach, fought the feeling of vomiting most of the day, exhausted detached. My brain would fluctuate between euphoria and complete inability to calculate or communicate.",UNK

I completely shut out the outside and withdrew from 90% of everything I liked. I read all of the reviews about the medicine as far a getting off of it, and I felt that it was pushing me further into a hole. I decided to take it every other day for one week, then half the dose and half the days. My advice is drink lots of water/ Fish oil every other day/ You must walk/ Eat even if you must force yourself/Sleep at night.",UNK
4646,I was pretty skeptical to try Accutane because I tried everything and didn&#039;t work. I eventually decided to give it a shot and was surprised to see my acne get better by the first month. Then it started to come back after about a year so I tried it again. My face was pretty clear for about 2 years after that. I would say it is worth it and really boosts your self esteem. The side effects are no fun but then again niether is acne. I actually think I might go back on it soon.,UNK

I thought that was all and if that had been all, I&#039;d rate this product a 10. I went to work and had the most excruciating stomach pains and nausea all day. So much that I thought I was going to pass out. At the end of the day (yesterday) I ended up pooping my pants w/absolutely no warning in a parking lot about 20 hours after taking the pills.

I stopped taking it after my issues with incontinence cleared up. Due to a illness, valley fever, the incontinence has returned. The doctor had me re-start the tolterodine . Well once again the side effects returned after two weeks, a fluttering in my ear canals, extreme irritability, and finally constipation. Doctor said the generics are not all the same and that Detrol might be better, but my insurance won&#039;t pay for the name brand drug. Guess I will just have to deal with the incontinence..",UNK

I have tried many other different medications to help cope with depression and anxiety-Effexor seemed to work on the brain, but what it did to my guts is far worse.

Anxiety++ depression++ stress++ weight++ Making an appointment to have Implanon removed. Only plus to Implanon for me is that I don&#039;t have any periods. That&#039;s the only plus. Insertion and removal is easy having done it once before. Lack of periods is great. Never again,UNK

It feels like I fell asleep in the sun after the medication wears off and is almost more embarrassing than my flushing condition.  I look great when I apply it initially, but I&#039;m saddened by the rebound :/",UNK

However, after taking it for about two months, I noticed I was very easily aggravated and overreacted to little things like crazy!  Very emotional, crying, deep emotional pain.  I did not wean off, I just stopped taking it because I didn&#039;t feel like &quot;me&quot;. No adverse reaction in stopping for me although I don&#039;t recommend stopping cold turkey for others.  Only plus was reduced appetite and increased libido!",UNK

I was taking Naboline and Marijuana which helped perfectly. For whatever reason my dr wants me to try something else . My questions is if something g works why put me on something that might work ?

But I&#039;m willing to try. The first three days I have felt similar effects but not to the extent that the other drugs help. I feel a bit more irritated with people , my hearing is more sensitive and my appetite is gone.",UNK

My GP had me start taking bupropion 75mg 2x a day and quit venlafaxine cold turkey.  It worked decently as a bridge to fight the nasty withdrawals from ven. Yes,  I had crazy brain zaps for a whole week. The first week it gave me a few Manic episodes,  anxiety and energy. The next week,  today i am feeling very depressed!!!

However, I woke several times during the night, and only ended up getting 3-4 hours of sleep (and felt very groggy the next day).  I might be experiencing some withdrawal from the Klonopin).

Pack one, I had breakthrough bleeding about two weeks after my normal period (pre BC) with no withdrawal bleed. I had extreme headaches, nausea, and anxiety. Pack two, same side effects but had a normal withdrawal bleed. Pack three, the side effects went away and my withdrawal bleed was less than normal. Super easy to care for. Pack four, my withdrawal bleed was abnormal. It lasted the entire four days of brown pulls but it itself was brown and not red. Pack five&#039;s withdrawal bleed started out brown and ended like a normal period. Color and all. My anxiety was so bad about pack five that I took two pregnancy tests just to rule out the weirdness.",UNK

I tried to wait it out to see if my body would eventually adjust but my period never got itself to be on a cycle. It got to the point where it wasn&#039;t worth it because even when I did have sex, I had bleeding/spotting so it took away my sexual confidence. It definitely was effective and did its job but the side effects were getting in the way of my life as well as my wallet as I was always at the store buying tampons and pads (and we know how expensive this can be). I decided to get the implant removed which was a bit of a difficult experience as well. Nexplanon is effective but still needs improvement.",UNK

A few days later I began bleeding slightly and I had to use panty liners for a couple days then it got a bit heavier and now I have to use liners or pads.

He prescribed me concerta. If anyone took speed before, it&#039;s exactly the same effect. You do get a down. You are more focused. You loose weight. However, you can go to sleep at night. The problem is, I don&#039;t take it everyday, I think it&#039;s a little bit too harsh for me. I&#039;ll go see him again, maybe I have psychological issues.

I was tired, emotional, and angry all the time to the point I was always in bed so it affected my performance in school. However, my body doesn&#039;t react well to any birth control.

4805,"Itchy, itchy! I&#039;ve found opioids analgesics are the best for my chronic pain.  Roxicodone caused pruritis for me. That might not seem like a big deal. However, when dealing with pain that&#039;s been constant for years, a side effect like non stop itching is one more thing that magnifies the pain. Then there&#039;s pain, itching, and more loss of sleep.

There were a couple of remedies. The doctor rxing a different medicine. Or taking an antihistamine to overcome the itching. 

In today&#039;s current anti-opioid environment, doctors seem more likely to throw up their hands, and say, &quot;Well I guess you&#039;re just not a good candidate for opioids!&quot; Which just isn&#039;t true. Switching worked like a charm for me.",UNK

Didn&#039;t know I was depressed until the doctor said that I was.  I went to him with complaints of stress (mostly work-related, some personal), weight gain (seems I focus on food and cravings a lot more these days, not to mention that I had a car accident on 4/03/09 and broke my neck, had to wear a halo for 3 months so that could also explain my weight gain of almost 30lbs), and difficulty falling asleep.  Side effects so far have been; insomnia, no changes really in appetite, and failure to have an orgasm! ",UNK

I was on strong pain medicine, but it didn&#039;t touch the bladder pain at all. I began taking Flomax and while the spasms didn&#039;t stop, the pain was more tolerable, and I passed my stones, 3 stones at once (2, 5, &amp; 6 mm).

The change in hormones throughout the month than dropping off to have my period has given me crazy mood swings.

I&#039;ve also been constantly spotting which doesn&#039;t bother me that much because it doesn&#039;t get everywhere. I just coexist with the mild blood, I would probably recommend this to another female but just warn her about the crappy mood swings.",UNK

I will say that each time I change the patch I do have a day of nausea. I also have minor irritation of the skin wherever I place the patch. I itch pretty bad some days more than others.

They probably say little or no copper makes it to your bloodstream. But I believe plenty does, and when that happens, when your blood has enough copper in it, it can begin storing copper in your organs and tissues in your body, causing tons of bad side effects, while also not showing on a blood test that anything is wrong.

This pill completely stopped my period with NO spotting or anything, and never any cramps. No acne, no mood changes. My breasts even grew. I was so happy. Now I am on month 4 and it is hell. I&#039;m having migraines and nausea all day, and bad mood swings. I am stopping this pill and going back to my OB.",UNK

If I miss a dose I get crying spells the next day (I take all my meds, 4, at night) at 150mg I started hearing things, unable to focus, and unable to hold urine - yes I learned that its a side effect. So am down to 75mg and am scared to change it but have expressed interest to my doctor. She added lithium and its helping (I also take tegretol and abilify) so overall, just do your own research before taking anything. Once you are on something you should NOT quit cold turkey.",UNK

Be aware if you have scarring, it will get worse before it gets better. I&#039;ll probably switch to Ortho Cyclen after month 3 if the acne isn&#039;t completely gone. The top ones I would recommend you for acne: 1. Yasmin, 2. Ortho Cyclen 3. Diane 35.

4868,"NOT WORTH THE SIDE EFFECTS!! Seriously. My GP gave me Alesse because she had some packets that were sent to her for free. I thought &quot;Hey why not&quot; and took them. Well, second month was the worst. Gained probably 10lbs because I was constantly hungry. Became lethargic and it made me more depressed. That went away in the third month. Then the acne started. As someone who was on accutane and had relatively pimple-less skin, this pill brought up old wounds. Turns out this pill which is often persrcibed to TREAT acne, is one of the worst BC that causes acne. My skin is now 10x more oily and i have painful zits on my cheeks, chin and lips. Also my boobs have gotten bigger which I hate. The pill also causes me really bad cramps &amp; my period was off.",UNK
4869,"It seemed okay. I was more alert than when using oxycodone. After three weeks, the side effects outweigh the positives. It was more psychotic than I had planned. After the 75 mg dose wore off, the drop off was steep. I felt very agitated and somewhat aggressive. Similar to prescribed amphetamine or steroid. It makes me so agitated that I have decided to go back to the Oxy. I also experienced some respiratory distress and diminished vision. Good try as an alternative but it is not for me. Kadian had similar reactions.",UNK
4870,"Overall, Aviane works pretty well. My periods are average and I have had no weight loss or gain. The one side effect I have had is terrible acne! My face was pretty much clear when I started (I&#039;d get minor breakouts around my period, but nothing bad). Within a couple of months of being on Aviane, my cheeks started breaking out really badly. I&#039;ve never even had acne on my cheeks. It&#039;s painful and there&#039;s scarring. I&#039;ve tried staying on it in hopes that my body would adjust and the breakouts would stop, but they&#039;ve only gotten worse. ",UNK

Started taking Rapaflo   8mg every night and it helped me sleep at least 3 or 4 hours without having to get up to the bathroom so often.  I think the radiation hurt my bladder and the result was frequent urination. Anyway to the point.  The Rapaflo works but I cannot experience a normal ejaculation.

After insertion I had the worst cramps for the first view months. Dr had told me at about 6 months if I notice I don&#039;t have a period, to not worry. My period stopped at 7/8 months started once more after that and then nothing. I will bend over and I feel a pain in my uterus, or in other ways, I feel it all the time.

This is the only pill I have ever been on and I can say that it does make me more emotional and sick at times, but no pregnancy! It does the job with little side effects: nausea and diarrhea.",UNK

Buspar helped at first, I was only on 5mg for five months, never went up in dose. After about 5 months, stressful events like job interviews pretty much made this med ineffective for me. I really liked this med as it had no side effects for me. No dizziness or nausea or &quot;brain zaps&quot;. My doctor put me on Paxil instead. Just started it, but it seems to be working.

I had quit for 3 weeks so I decided to stop taking Chantix as the side effects were really starting to affect me. The nausea, constipation, tired/groggy and disconnected at work and home, getting mad at the smallest things and yes even suicidal thoughts. I had to stop taking this medicine.

My Dr. Increased my dose steadily and with that my weight increased rapidly. Other side effects were uncontrollable diarrhea and TMJ. 
 I discontinued the medication and after 9 months on it was left with a 17 pound weight gain mostly in my belly and back/upper sides.

The acne could not be contributed to anything else - I&#039;m a healthy and active vegetarian with an esthetician for a mother. I also had no sex drive, which was my first major red flag that something serious was out of whack. I also went from a D to an F cup - cool for my boyfriend but not for my wardrobe.

I was given a list of medications and told to study them and choose which one I felt most comfortable with and I chose Copaxone.

My bladder went bad. Gained weight. From the get go, Risperdal made me EXTREMELY ANXIOUS upon taking it.  It was the culprit behind my itchy skin and bladder issues too. BE CAREFUL. Caused SEVERE INNER RESTLESSNESS!",UNK
4923,"I took Paxil for 10 years.  Started on 20mg and had intense anxiety, confusion, panic. Doctor insisted it was all in my head.  Therapist told me to cut the dose in 1/2.  Felt somewhat better. Went up to 20mg after a few months and began to get brain zaps. A close friend told me I had lost my personality. Slept 10-14 hrs a night and frustrated my partner because of sleeping, no sex drive and no ability to feel sexual pleasure.  Effects of alcohol intensified-  passed out from 2 drinks or became over-emotional.  Tapered from 20mg to 0 slowly over the 10 yrs.  Each tiny decrease resulted in ~2wk period of increased anxiety. I think overall it numbed the panic but CBT therapy and getting older may have been more or similarly effective. ",UNK
4924,"I have been struggling with acne since I graduated high school. It got REALLY BAD. Around that time (high school) is when I first took isotretinoin. I took it for about 3 months and it worked wonders for me. However 8 years later the bad acne has reappeared. I take Amnesteem now. I&#039;m in my second week and its making it worse. I don&#039;t remember this medicine doing this the first time. The only side effects I&#039;ve experienced was dry lips, dry skin and dry eyes so far. I hope this gets better for me. If it does I will update this comment.",UNK
4925,"It seemed okay. I was more alert than when using oxycodone. After three weeks, the side effects outweigh the positives. It was more psychotic than I had planned. After the 75 mg dose wore off, the drop off was steep. I felt very agitated and somewhat aggressive. Similar to prescribed amphetamine or steroid. It makes me so agitated that I have decided to go back to the Oxy. I also experienced some respiratory distress and diminished vision. Good try as an alternative but it is not for me. Kadian had similar reactions.",UNK
4926,"I was taking to control facial hair growth. I just finished my first pack and I&#039;ve see all the negative side effects. My period was light, only needing a panty liner but I&#039;ve been spotting for over two weeks now. I never had heavy periods so it&#039;s kind of annoying. I did get and am still bloated. The hair growth have not stopped, still grows at the same pace. If no change in three months, I plan to stop.",UNK
4927,"I was put on topamax for about 3 weeks for excruciating migraines that I would get just about daily. While it was pretty effective at decreasing my headaches (I only had about one or two in the three weeks I was on it), I experienced side effects from it. I was taken off it for a few days and then put back on to see if I still had the same problems.  A little bit of lip tingling but nothing major.  When I upped the dose like I was supposed to my gums started hurting so my doctor took me off it and put me on Depakote.",UNK
4928,Started out ok on this after switching from Lisinopril which controlled BP to 120/80 then started getting excruciating bad spasms which I attribute to this then came the sudden dizzy spells. Blacked out behind the wheel and got in a car accident last month. Fortunately I was not injured and only minimal damage to my car. This stuff is scary but seems to control BP reasonably well.,UNK
4929,I am on the last week of the second month of this pill and I have been spotting a brown discharge( not heavy enough for a pad or tampon but annoying)  since the last week of the first month. It wont stop I&#039;m getting ready to start my third month so my first period week on the pill is 3 weeks away. If the spotting doesnt&#039; stop after my period week I&#039;m calling my doc for a new pill.,UNK
4930,"After 2 months on the generic form of this pill, my doctor suggested I move to Loestrin. It seemed pretty awesome because for the 3 months I was on it, I had no periods or cramps. I did experience weight gain, breast tenderness, major mood swings, loss of libido and slight increase in acne. Personally, I loved not having periods. It was cool and it saved me money on tampons. But the lack of sex drive was enough to convince me and my doctor that this wasn&#039;t the birth control for me. I&#039;ve switched to Ortho Tri-cyclen and lost the 7 pounds I had gained in the 3 months I was on Loestrin. I&#039;m cramping and having periods again but my sex drive is back at a decent level and my emotions are better in check. 

Don&#039;t be afraid to switch birth controls.",UNK
4931,"Second birth control I&#039;ve been on, and I&#039;ve been on it for over a year. It gives me the worst headaches and acne. I put on about 10lbs and CANNOT get rid of it. I feel disgusting. My boobs didn&#039;t get any bigger. My periods are always right on schedule and never heavy but the rest of the month is a roller coaster with my emotions, weight, etc.",UNK
4932,I have been on Narvasc 5mg for about 4 months.  It doesn&#039;t control my blood pressure for the 24 hours and my pulse constantly stays elevated.  I have swelling in my feet and ankles and I&#039;m tired all the time. I get flushing sensations and ringing in my ears sometimes.  Also feel dizzy at times and have dry mouth. All these medications are horrible. We have no choice but to suffer if we take them or not take them.  ,UNK
4933,"I was prescribed this due to acne around my chin/ forehead and black heads on my nose as well as my cheeks. The first two days of applying this at night it was fine. On the third day I woke up to wash my face and noticed that my face was red and when I used my daily face wash it stung like crazy. After washing my face, I always use a facial moisturizer, and that even stung when I put it on! Later on in the day I noticed that my face was so flaky. I did not apply the following two days due to stinging and extreme dryness. I plan to use it again when my symptoms die down, but instead of using it every day.. I&#039;ll use it every other day instead. I think that this product is too harsh to use on your face every day.",UNK
4934,"Everything affects everyone differently. With that said I have had the nexplanon for just over a year and I&#039;m not loving it. I had the Mirena for 5 years. No issues and period was very light. 5 years is the max then you need a new one. My doctor who inserted the first one couldn&#039;t get the replacement in.  So moved to plan B. My doctor mentioned nexplanon because I didn&#039;t like pills or nuvaring. Insertion was easy and pretty painless. They use a local anesthetic.  My doctor thought I would react in a similar manner to the mirena but that hasn&#039;t been the case. My skin is oilier, it breaks out, and my period is much heavier. Not to mention I gained 10 lbs. Probably will get it removed once I decide on another option.",UNK

Most of the time they are on the aggressive side. I&#039;m a 32 year old male.",UNK

I had horrible mood swings, hot flashes, weight gain, etc. I didn&#039;t get a period, I loved that. There are other side effects though you&#039;re more likely to catch virus&#039; or have a sore throat all the time. Headaches that are beyond crippling I went to the hospital for them. I had it removed not long ago to find out I may need help to have a child if I ever want one in the near future. I think everyone is different who receives it but really read over the side effects.

4938,"Was on 150mg for three weeks then went up to 300mg for a week.  Had to stop taking it.  Had a weird experience where I was standing beside a running shower; just standing there in a daze.  Not for like 10 seconds, but standing there, standing there...   That was the last time I took them, now on Lexapro.",UNK
4939,"For the first 3 months everything was dandy until I found out that in those 3 months I got pregnant I got this to prevent anything like that happen, however my nurse didn&#039;t inform me that certain pills can reduce its efficiency, I ended up having a miscarriage. 
So I put that failure down to lack of knowledge, as time went on I had 2 months of no period then an entire month of bleeding. I&#039;ve been getting spots and hot flushes caused by this, not to mention I&#039;ve suffered from severe depression and anxiety caused by the implanon which caused me to stop eating because I had constant knots in my stomach and despite this no eating I&#039;ve went up 3 dress sizes! 
I suggest getting the 3 month jab and seeing your reaction it may not be horrible for everyone.",UNK
4940,Got sick a good three times during the first week and felt dizzy. Continued to take it for another 2 weeks every morning but it made me drowsy to the point that I had to take a nap everyday. Switched to taking it at night before bed and could not sleep at all. On a positive note I did notice my concentration levels increased a bit but was surprised how I could read an article or a textbook and remember the information I had just read.,UNK

I have had 0 sex drive since I got this thing put in. My boyfriend and I used to have sex about 4 times a week and now it&#039;s down to maybe once a month if I don&#039;t have a yeast infection.

4943,"Had propofol last year for an upper GI, woke up screaming crying but didn&#039;t feel terrible. However, a few days later I had gastrointestinal issues like never before and anxiety, panic, and what felt like I was having a heart attack. This happened twice and I went to two different ERs. Just anxiety. Just had a D&amp;C yesterday and they used Versed, propofol, and fentanyl. Felt worse coming out of this due to it being heavier sleep but was &quot;off&quot; the rest of the day and this morning. Today I felt pretty good but started getting the anxiety panic chest thing again. I think it&#039;s the propofol that has some sort of side effect. Feels like a lighter version of last year. Scary stuff. I hope it doesn&#039;t continue!",UNK
4944,I&#039;ve been a Type I diabetic for 14 years and just recently (within the past month) made the switch from Lantus to Tresiba. I have had constant headaches in the afternoons since switching and today is the second time the pen has just stopped working. I will be partially through the injection when the pen stops dispersing the insulin - you can press on the plunger but nothing comes out and the numbers do not go down. Not having insulin when your life depends on it is the scariest feeling in the world.,UNK

I was not suppose to go back to the doctor for 30 days. But luckily last night I had my blood pressure checked, it was 151/98-I was shocked! I have only been on the medicine 15 days. Advair probably helped me through my upper respiratory problems, but I think I should have been warned about this side effect.",UNK
4946,"I have been taking Savella for about 4 weeks, 2 weeks at 50mg morning and night and have been having lots of side effects, almost flu like symptoms. Weakness, shakes, lightheadedness, cold, then hot. I have been reading lots of reviews, because I didn&#039;t think it could be this medicine, but I guess it can be. I work graveyards and I think I might try 50 mg in the morning and 25 mg at night and go from there. I was on Lyrica for 9 yrs and it was so expensive and the Savella is half the copay Lyrica was. I&#039;m not ready to give up on it yet, but I am so hot all the time, but the weight gain from Lyrica was the reason I decided to try Savella since my insurance will cover now. I&#039;m hoping for the best. Good Luck.",UNK

I tend to have spotting for two to three weeks at a time during the active pills, even when I take them at EXACTLY the same time everyday. My period starts off great but then gets real heavy towards the end. Sex drive is non-existent for a few weeks at a time.

Developed a chronic cough sore throat, and sinus issue lasting nearly six months. Misdiagnosed as strep, Flu, Bacterial infection, and then five months into it an allergist (the only doc that listened) tells me it is a common side effect for the Exforge. I stopped taking it today.

The Blisovi is free with my insurance and is why I switched.  I am in the same boat with everyone else that has been taken this...not happy. I&#039;ve experienced weight gain, tender boobs and, a supper spotty period. No tampon needed but maybe a lite one every now and again.  I just can&#039;t stand not know if I&#039;m going to spot and having to wear panty-liners everyday is really annoying.  Long story short I am stuck with this until I have new insurance or cough up a fee every month for Yaz again.

I started Paxil at 10mg and went all the way up to 40mg, within the first couple of months. This drug did wonders for my panic disorder, PTSD, and anxiety, but made my depression worse! The reason I decided to stop taking it is because I didn&#039;t want to get out of bed anymore, and I gained about 60lbs since I started taking it. Funny they call it an antidepressant, when in the end it made my depression worse. I am trying Wellbutrin now... but I won&#039;t know how well that works until I&#039;m completely off the Paxil in a couple weeks. The withdrawal is awful, even while weaning.",UNK

My MD started me on Lexapro, which wasn&#039;t good for me. I suffered through work for a day but was too spacey. My job requires strong concentration skills. Prozac next which made me yawn like a lion. By week 3 I did not feel sad, but felt sick and had yawns like a lion.

Once I noticed my weight gain I had to make healthier choices and definitely work out. I just don&#039;t like that it makes me tired. I read on here that it affects your sex drive.

No issues and period was very light. 5 years is the max then you need a new one. My doctor who inserted the first one couldn&#039;t get the replacement in.  So moved to plan B. My doctor mentioned nexplanon because I didn&#039;t like pills or nuvaring. Insertion was easy and pretty painless. They use a local anesthetic.  My doctor thought I would react in a similar manner to the mirena but that hasn&#039;t been the case. My skin is oilier, it breaks out, and my period is much heavier. Not to mention I gained 10 lbs. Probably will get it removed once I decide on another option.",UNK
4978,"My 6 year old son has Aspergers and ADHD. He takes Strattera and 3mg of Intuniv daily for about 3 months now.  While it seems as if I can actually get his attention now while before I could not hardly at all, he is still having trouble paying attention and completing work in school. He is getting in less trouble, fewer outbursts and staying in his seat. Though I feel I should credit that to the Strattera which he started just a month before the Intuniv. He can hold conversation now too. The big issue has been headaches and stomach pain, including vomiting and heartburn. He would say his stomach and chest burns and is hot. Well recently an ulcer was found. ",UNK
4979,"I have been using the Implanon for almost 4 years. When I first got it, it was great! I hardly ever got my period. I would get one period every 8 months or so for about 4 weeks, which I can&#039;t complain. Once I got it replaced last year after my 3 years expired, it all changed. I gained at least 15 lbs, I go to the gym regularly and it&#039;s nearly impossible for me to lose weight. I get my period every 4-5 weeks and it last 3 weeks every time. I&#039;m always moody, tired and have no sex drive. I enjoy this birth control only because it has prevented pregnancy, but I am starting to hate the side effects my body is experiencing.",UNK
4980,"I got my Implanon inserted September 2009, 2 1/2 months after my son was born. Before insertion I had a sex drive, good skin, lost all my weight from my pregnancy and wasn&#039;t angry or impatient all the time. I didn&#039;t have a period until December, that lasted 5 days. My next cycle was end of January and was heavy until March. I have had a period either every month for 14 days straight or every other week with 7 days of bleeding. I like the idea of no pill but this has got to stop. My OB has put me on the pill to stop my bleeding but I take the pill everyday for the last 5 months. And I still have it every other week. I have bad acne, moodiness and gained 30 pounds. My marriage is probably suffering because I have no sex drive. It&#039;s time to get it out!",UNK
4981,I usually work a 10 hr shift in the afternoon but my boss has changed my Saturday shift to 5am-1pm. We live on a farm and have 3 outside dogs that like to bark at night.  The first morning shift I only got 2 hrs sleep because of our dogs. I purchased Zzquill to get some help falling asleep the night before my morning shifts. I took the recommended dose (2pills) at 8pm. I went to bed at 8:30. I didn&#039;t feel any effect from the medication until almost 10:30!! And then I woke up again at 12:30am! I do not recommend Zzquill if you want to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep.,UNK
4982,"I was given baclofen for spasms in my hands. The side effects, including blurred vision were prohibitive to taking for any length of time to properly rate any effectiveness of this drug.",UNK
4983,"I have been on Ranbaxy generic Plaquenil for 11 months now. I don&#039;t think think it helps me very much, but I continue to take it because I am not experiencing any side effects. My condition is not well-controlled with this drug alone and I will soon start an additional DMARD after recently finding out I am intolerant of MTX. My battle with Sjogren&#039;s has been so much more than glandular issues. It has attacked my biliary system, causing me to lose my gall bladder and have complex issues with the pyloric valve, lower esophageal sphincter and sphincter of oddi. This causes a variety of symptoms such as bile and acid reflux, bile salt diarrhea,  nausea, vomiting up bile and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. I have signs of kidney disease too",UNK
4984,"Keppra alone did not do anything for me except make me depressed and have &quot;Keppra rage&quot;.  I was up to 1500mg 2x a day and would still have a grand mal about every 4 months and absence seizures in between.  My neuro switched me to Topamax, Depakote and everything else but would break out in rashes or have horrible diarrhea and every other side effect.  Back to Keppra I am 2000mg 2x a day (400mg a day total) now, weighing 175 (hell of a dose) and got put on Lamictal as well up to 100mg 2x a day of that.  1 month since addition of Lamictal and higher dose of Keppra and no seizure yet.  We shall see.",UNK
4985,I just recently got this medicine for tooth pain. As I am going to dds for several issues.. My RX I 5/325. I&#039;ve noticed it minimizes the pain but doesn&#039;t take it away. I also am going g thru major nausea sometime vomiting. It makes me so tired feeling and always thirsty feeling... I may need to just stick with motrin.. I will talk to her about this when I go for my next appt on tuesday,UNK
4986,"I am 21, no kids. I got the Skyla inserted in May 2015. The insertion was uncomfortable but nothing too painful. My first period with it in lasted 2 weeks. I found out that I had a 3cm cyst on my ovary when I went in to see if the IUD was in place. I have very sharp pains in my ovaries for about 3 weeks out of the month. Most of the time it is uncomfortable but rest of the time I have to stop what I am doing, curl up into a ball, and then after 15-20 seconds I can get back up and keep doing what I was doing. I am not sure if I will be keeping it in for much longer... But on the plus side, I am not pregnant.",UNK
4987,"I started taking this in August of this year, and the first period I had after starting this bc was excruciating. I had severe cramping, swollen &amp; painful breasts, and bloating like crazy. I stuck it out because I know with bc you have to give it a few months to let your body adjust. My periods leveled out, but I only made it 4 months before I had to go back and request something else. My anxiety was exacerbated, depression came back, was extremely emotional, constantly hungry (gained weight because of that), went up 2 cup sizes due to swelling &amp; weight gain, and was bloated all the time. It was a nightmare. It did prevent pregnancy though, so there&#039;s that. I&#039;ve felt totally normal since switching to the mini pill. This just wasn&#039;t for me.",UNK
4988,"I first started Junel for my periods because I experienced heavy bleeding that would last for days. I never had awful acne but my skin was not super clear, with the first months of being on it my acne was so bad! But now after 11 months my skin is super clear and smooth! Even though my periods are less bleeding and less days, I have had a lot of side effects! I work out regularly and eat healthy yet I have gained over 10 lbs from when I first started talking this, my mood switches too often and I usually feel mad a lot of the time, and my face and hair has became extremely oily and greasy within the last few months. I do not think it has been worth it!",UNK
4989,"I&#039;ve been on Sronyx for about 4 weeks now. The 2nd week into it I was extremely moody and emotional. I&#039;ve always been physically active, but lately its made me lethargic. It definitely increased my appetite and now that I&#039;m on my fourth week, I&#039;m extremely bloated.",UNK
4990,I was on the Depo Vera for 4 years. It prevents pregnancy and I didn&#039;t have to worry about taking any meds or what not. But if I didn&#039;t take the depo right when it was due I would spot like crazy. I decided to stop because it just wasn&#039;t normal. I stop taking the depo vera (Feb-16-2015) it is now (June-3-2015) I&#039;m still bleeding. My sex life is a wreck me and my boyfriend just deal with it because I will not suffer because of this lol. My advice don&#039;t do it. It&#039;s horrible and it really messes up your mensual cycle.,UNK
4991,"I have had 3 major low back and neck surgeries within the past several years.  I have excruciating hip and low back pain and can never get to sleep. I wake up several times a night putting ice packs on my low back and hips. I went to see a pain doctor today, and he has put me on Neurontin, gradually increasing it to 300mg 3X a day.  I have to say that it hasn&#039;t done a whole lot for me.  I woke up at 3am this morning hurting.  I am feeling highly agitated, so not sure if its the medication or just me being in pain.  I am manic depressive and take Seroquel, have for years.  I am just not getting pain relief.  Does it take time with Neurotin to work?",UNK
4992,"I got Nexplanon inserted December 2012. I was previously on the pill for 5 years which worked great for me, but I began having seizures last July. Because of the seizures, I switched my birth control to a progesterone based birth control in case the estrogen was provoking my seizures. I&#039;ve now had Nexplanon for almost 5 months and have been bleeding every day since. I&#039;ve also gained about 15 pounds. It has been horrible for me. I would love to just take it out, but I spent $700 on this and would like to wait it out and see if it gets better. ",UNK
4993,"I had a brief episode of a-fib following severe pneumonia, so the docs put me on Eliquis and have insisted I stick with it despite the fact my a-fib resolved on its own two weeks after multiple failed cardioversion attempts and a course of amiodarone. 

Now I find myself having dark, very bloody bowel movements accompanied by severe abdominal cramping. Yuck. I have IBS, but this is different. 

Time to insist my docs take me off of it?",UNK
4994,"I have been taking this for night trips to the bathroom .
Started a 3mg  2 years ago and just started slowly increasing to 10mg. I stopped taking due to the side effects of rapid pounding heart beat, chest pains, dizziness, no real change in sexual functions which is good thing. Not a big change in night trips to the bathroom.
Off to the Doctor today.",UNK
4995,"The nexplanon made me have a period for 3 months straight after I got it, and it also made me gain over 60 pounds, but for it to prevent pregnancy it&#039;s great. I had this birth control for 3 years I get it out in November.",UNK
4996,"I&#039;ve been taking wellbutrin 150 SR twice a day for 3 months now, I started with 150mg the first month and 300mg from the second month. It hasn&#039;t really helped me with depression like Prozac and Lexapro did. I told my doctor that I didn&#039;t want to gain weight like I did on those drugs so he prescribed me bupropion. I have more energy, I&#039;ve lost weight, but the depression is still there.",UNK
4997,"I started lithium nearly 2 years ago,  thyroid went almost instantly along with energy and about 10% of my hair.  Then followed by liver (they keep saying liver isn&#039;t affected but I never had a problem with my liver and had blood tests done 3 months before my lithium start). I have a huge personal event happen that shattered those around me but I am completely numb.  When you can&#039;t feel then you have to ask is it worth it.",UNK
4998,I was on Remicade for five years and the Crohn&#039;s Disease went into remission BUT it did a number on my immune system.  I got staph infection and eventually a septic hip.  Had to have hip surgery which consisted of a spacer for 6 months as well as medication through a pic line.  In hospital for three and a 1/2 months and nearly another 3 months at home before I was in condition to have a hip replacement.  I also have kidney disease which is partly due to medications I took while fighting Crohn&#039;s disease.  Just waiting to die and get these diseases over with.   Really consider the side effects of Remicade - septic hip was not mentioned.,UNK
4999,"I have been using Axiron (60 mg daily) for two months now. Before I started my testosterone level was around 430, which is a little low for a 40 year old male (has been as low as 190). I was doing the injections, but the constant ups and downs were terrible. Needless to say I was optimistic when told about Axiron, but it&#039;s proven to be short lived. I  had my testosterone level checked again last week and it dropped to 217! I suspected something was wrong when fatigue started setting back in. Anyway, I went back to my doctor today and he increased the dose to 120 mg daily. Will have my level checked again in 10 weeks, Hope it starts working. ",UNK
