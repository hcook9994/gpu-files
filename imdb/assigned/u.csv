19,It's a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their rollicking,UNK
20,"kids. I felt like instead of a movie ticket, I should have been given a NAMBLA",UNK
21,"membership. Based upon Thomas Rockwell's respected Book, How To Eat Fried Worms starts like any children's",UNK
22,"story: moving to a new town. The new kid, fifth grader Billy Forrester was once popular,",UNK
23,"but has to start anew. Making friends is never easy, especially when the only prospect is",UNK
24,"Poindexter Adam. Or Erica, who at 4 1/2 feet, is a giant. Further complicating things is",UNK

26,Death Ring: a Crackerjack ring that is rumored to kill you if you're punched with it.,UNK
27,"But not immediately. No, the death ring unleashes a poison that kills you in the eight",UNK
28,grade. Joe and his axis of evil welcome Billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms,UNK
29,"into his thermos. Once discovered, Billy plays it cool, swearing that he eats worms all the",UNK
30,"time. Then he throws them at Joe's face. Ewww! To win them over, Billy reluctantly bets",UNK
31,"that he can eat 10 worms. Fried, boiled, marinated in hot sauce, squashed and spread on",UNK
32,"a peanut butter sandwich. Each meal is dubbed an exotic name like the ""Radioactive Slime Delight,""",UNK
33,in which the kids finally live out their dream of microwaving a living organism. If you've,UNK
34,"ever met me, you'll know that I have an uncontrollably hearty laugh. I felt like a",UNK
35,"creep erupting at a toddler whining that his ""dilly dick"" hurts. But Fried Worms is wonderfully",UNK
36,"disgusting. Like a G-rated Farrelly brothers film, it is both vomitous and delightful. Writer/director Bob Dolman",UNK
37,is also a savvy storyteller. To raise the stakes the worms must be consumed by 7,UNK
38,pm. In addition Billy holds a dark secret: he has an ultra-sensitive stomach. Dolman also has,UNK
39,"a keen sense of perspective. With such accuracy, he draws on children's insecurities and tendency to",UNK
40,"exaggerate mundane dilemmas. If you were to hyperbolize this movie the way kids do their quandaries,",UNK
41,you will see that it is essentially about war. Freedom-fighter and freedom-hater use pubescent boys as,UNK
42,"pawns in proxy wars, only to learn a valuable lesson in unity. International leaders can learn",UNK
43,"a thing or two about global peacekeeping from Fried Worms. At the end of the film,",UNK
44,"I was comforted when two chaperoning mothers behind me, looked at each other with befuddlement and",UNK
45,"agreed, ""That was a great movie."" Great, now I won't have to register myself in any",UNK

47,"You probably all already know this by now, but 5 additional episodes never aired can be",UNK
48,viewed on ABC.com I've watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly,UNK
49,"my favorite show, ever. It's a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled.",UNK
50,"The actors that played Laura, Whit, Carlos, Mae, Damian, Anya and omg, Steven Caseman - are",UNK
51,all incredible and so natural in those roles. Even the kids are great. Wonderful show. So,UNK
52,sad that it's gone. Of course I wonder about the reasons it was canceled. There is,UNK
53,no way I'll let myself believe that Ms. Moynahan's pregnancy had anything to do with it.,UNK
54,It was in the perfect time slot in this market. I've watched all the episodes again,UNK
55,on ABC.com - I hope they all come out on DVD some day. Thanks for reading.,UNK
56,"I saw the movie with two grown children. Although it was not as clever as Shrek,",UNK
57,I thought it was rather good. In a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on,UNK
58,"spring break, there was not a sound so I know the children all liked it. There",UNK
59,parents also seemed engaged. The death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps,UNK
60,"and comments. Hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids. As such, it was successful",UNK
61,although I liked it too. Personally I liked the Scrat!!,UNK
62,You're using the IMDb. You've given some hefty votes to some of your favourite films. It's,UNK
63,"something you enjoy doing. And it's all because of this. Fifty seconds. One world ends, another",UNK
64,begins. How can it not be given a ten? I wonder at those who give this,UNK
65,a seven or an eight... exactly how could THE FIRST FILM EVER MADE be better? For,UNK
66,"the record, the long, still opening shot is great showmanship, a superb innovation, perfectly suited to",UNK
67,the situation. And the dog on the bike is a lovely touch. All this within fifty,UNK
68,seconds. The word genius is often overused. THIS is genius.,UNK
69,This was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the,UNK
70,transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family. Well-acted and,UNK
71,"well-directed. If there were any flaws, I'd have to say that the story showed the typical",UNK
72,suburban family and their difficulties again. What about all people of all cultural backgrounds? I would,UNK
73,love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown - like in real,UNK
74,"life. Nevertheless, the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how",UNK
75,a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker. Loved the film and it,UNK
76,brought tears to my eyes,UNK
77,"Made after QUARTET was, TRIO continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short",UNK
78,"stories by Maugham. Here the three stories are THE VERGER, MR. KNOW-IT-ALL, and SANITORIUM. The first",UNK
79,"two are comic (THE VERGER is like a prolonged joke, but one with a good pay-off),",UNK
80,and the last more serious (as health issues are involved). Again the author introduces the film,UNK
81,"and the stories. James Hayter, soon to have his signature role as Samuel Pickwick, is the",UNK
82,"hero in THE VERGER. He holds this small custodial-type job in a church, but the new",UNK
83,Vicar (Michael Hordern) is an intellectual snob. When he hears Hayter has no schooling he fires,UNK
84,"him. Hayter has saved some money, so he tells his wife (Kathleen Harrison) he fancies buying",UNK
85,"a small news and tobacco shop. He has a good eye, and his store thrives. Soon",UNK
86,"he has a whole chain of stores. When his grandchild is christened by Hordern, the latter",UNK
87,is amazed to see how prosperous his ex-Verger. The payoff is when bank manager Felix Aylmer,UNK
88,meets with Hayter about diversifying his investments. I'll leave it to you to hear the unintentional,UNK
89,but ironic coda of the meeting. According to Maugham he met a man like Max Kelada,UNK
90,"(Nigel Patrick) on a cruise. In MR. KNOW-IT-ALL Kelada is a splashy, friendly, and slightly overbearing",UNK
91,type from the Middle East who is on a business trip (regarding jewelry) by steamship. His,UNK
92,"state-room mate is Mr. Grey (the ever quiet and proper Wilfred Hyde-White) who is somewhat, silently",UNK
93,"disapproving of Max. Max likes to enliven things, and soon is heavily involved in the ship's",UNK
94,entertainment. At this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non-Maugham story,UNK
95,"and film CHINA SEAS (1935), as Max makes a bet that he can tell a real",UNK
96,piece of jewelry from a fake (after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is,UNK
97,real). I won't describe the way Max rises to the occasion. SANITORIUM is the longest segment.,UNK
98,"Roland Culver plays ""Ashenden"" (the fictional alter-ego of Maugham - a writer and one time spy",UNK
99,as in Hitchcock's THE SECRET AGENT). Here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple,UNK
100,"of months for his health. He finds a remarkable crew of people, including Jean Simmons as",UNK
101,"a frail but beautiful young woman, Finlay Currie as an irascible Scotsman, John Laurie as a",UNK
102,"second irascible Scotsman who is ""at war"" with Currie, Raymond Huntley as a quiet patient who",UNK
103,"only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up, and Michael Rennie",UNK
104,as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness. Culver watches as three stories,UNK
105,"among these characters play out to their conclusions. The last, dealing with Simmons and Rennie, is",UNK
106,"ironic but deeply moving. It was a dandy follow-up to the earlier QUARTET, and well worth",UNK
107,watching.,UNK

126,exploit women and strongly asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they,UNK
127,band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty,UNK

135,"When I rented this movie to watch it, I knew that it was not going to",UNK
136,be a mindbender movie. Instead I thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone,UNK
137,is going to get a serious beating. And you know what it worked. Kurt Russel did,UNK
138,what I though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was. I,UNK
139,recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action,UNK
140,film.,UNK
141,It's hard to say sometimes why exactly a film is so effective. From the moment I,UNK
142,"first came across ""The Stone Boy"", something told me it would be a great film. In",UNK
143,"spite of that, it seemed very unlikely that I'd ever have the opportunity to actually see",UNK
144,"it for myself. Then, one day, while looking through the online catalogue of my local library,",UNK
145,I saw that they had recently purchased the DVD release of this film. Which I'm extremely,UNK
146,"glad for, because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old VHS",UNK
147,"copy could never replicate. And speaking of the cinematography, I must single it out as far",UNK
148,and above the most stunning aspect of this film. As a photographer who pursues very nearly,UNK
149,"the exact visual style portrayed in ""The Stone Boy"", I'm a firm believer in the fact",UNK
150,"that a great cinematographer can almost single-handedly carry a film. Here, he has a lot of",UNK
151,"help from an extremely talented cast, and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs.",UNK
152,But to have Juan Ruiz Anchía behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty.,UNK
153,And you can almost never say that. Most films would never even expect such a thing,UNK
154,"of you. Scene after scene captures some detail, some little bit of visual magic that takes",UNK
155,"your breath away. The director, Christopher Cain, has had a long and interesting career. As far",UNK
156,"as I can gather, this film is not very representative of it. But, sometimes, to catch",UNK
157,"a director near the beginnings of his career, before all the big budgets and loss of",UNK
158,"focus, there's a real subtle magic to be found. Cain steps back in this film, lets",UNK
159,"things happen with a life of their own, and then ever further. Much like early John",UNK
160,"Sayles films, characters are given space to breathe, time to talk. Side stories happen because they",UNK
161,"do, and that's how life is. Cain displays a remarkable, raw, even outright painful understanding of",UNK
162,"human nature in this film. The acting ties much of this story together. When people talk,",UNK
163,"when they exist in this film, they do so as actual people, not held back by",UNK
164,the fact that they are playing characters. Gina Berriault's script allows immensely talented and respected actors,UNK
165,"like Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Frederic Forrest to spend time simply existing. Whether",UNK
166,"the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance, it all comes down",UNK
167,"with the weight of pure reality. When you look at the actors involved, or the great",UNK
168,"soundtrack by James Horner, it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten. Maybe",UNK
169,"much of what makes ""The Stone Boy"" what it is was the time period it was",UNK
170,made in. There's this 1970s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my,UNK
171,"own childhood. People talk of the 80s in terms of modern styles and music, but that's",UNK
172,"not the 80s I lived in or remember. The look of the images, the understated and",UNK
173,"dark knowing quality of the acting, and the overall result should get under the skin of",UNK
174,any person who grew up in or near this era of time in North America. I,UNK
175,"see myself in this. I see how I saw the world. And a film like ""The",UNK
176,"Stone Boy"" sees the world for how it truly is. For more of this feeling, please",UNK
177,"see: The Black Stallion (1979), Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), Testament (1983), Places in",UNK

190,are rockin' Rollers. GO RAMONES!!!! This is a great movie.............. For ME!,UNK
191,This is a film that was very well done. I had heard mixed reviews while it,UNK
192,was in production and have been waiting for its release! Cheers to the director and all,UNK
193,the actors. The supporting cast gave Eva Mendez what she needed to take this to the,UNK
194,"top. As everyone else here states, the latter portion of the film is riveting. Katie Cassidy",UNK
195,"did an amazing job with her character, being she had not done a lot of work",UNK

209,OK heres what I say: The movie was excellent. I am a huge Nancy fan and,UNK
210,I have read all 1-56 original books and I went on to read more. I am,UNK
211,now on 96. Beware of villains giving this movie a lower grade than it should have.,UNK
212,All clues point to a wonderful movie! I loved the whole thing. So what Nancy is,UNK
213,in current time. She is still old fashioned like she is in the books! People who,UNK
214,haven't read more than 5 books are complaining about the view of Nancy. I have read,UNK
215,all of them and I think Emma is perfect and that Nancy was perfect. I found,UNK
216,parts of the movie spooky. I loved the exciting car chases and get aways. I loved,UNK
217,the clues. I solved the mystery myself! It was really wonderful. I suggest you go see,UNK
218,it since people who have been complaining know nothing of A what a good movie is,UNK
219,and B about Nancy Drew. Go see it. It may not be Oscar worthy but its,UNK
220,really a good movie.,UNK
221,"This is one of the first films I can remember, or maybe the first one. Exactly",UNK
222,"the beautiful kind of film than introduce a kid, sweetly, into the world of violence and",UNK
223,"addictions were we live. A little bit of Babe, Casino and Constantine, all this well mixed",UNK
224,"into a carton, and we get this. I don't know if its truly rated for kids,",UNK
225,"but I think it was very cool, very funny and interesting. I hate when a film",UNK
226,(spescially a carton)can have a good end and its ruining because every character must have a,UNK
227,"happy end, even if it sounds weird (Im not a bitter person).But this was OK, he",UNK
228,"simply goes heaven and they let it in that way. All this is just a critic,",UNK
229,Its a good movie an something new. very touching and I gotta go,UNK
230,This film is worth seeing alone for Jared Harris' outstanding portrayal of John Lennon. It doesn't,UNK
231,"matter that Harris doesn't exactly resemble Lennon; his mannerisms, expressions, posture, accent and attitude are pure",UNK

233,"whether Paul McCartney & Wings' ""Silly Love Songs"" is worthy of #1 status in America.",UNK
234,I was 10 years old when this show was on TV. By far it was my,UNK
235,favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was just gorgeous.... I just order the DVD,UNK
236,"(15 episodes). They didn't have super-powers. They just had superior human skills (strength, hearing, sight). The",UNK
237,"3 actors were very good in their rolls, very believable. There was a good story in",UNK
238,"each episode. At the time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script",UNK
239,"was suppose to be good, and the characters performs were great. There was no fancy stuff,",UNK
240,like in other shows. They didn't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make,UNK
241,a light show. I highly recommend this TV show to anybody that like good stuff.,UNK
242,"Here's another movie that should be loaded into a satellite, fired into space and pointed in",UNK

264,Frank Kramer is actually the same Gianfranco Parolini who brought the world SARTANA in 1968 and,UNK

266,and action/adventure genre film scene from the 1960's/1970's and by the time of YETI he was,UNK
267,probably delighted to get the work. I would say that this is his most adventuresome movie,UNK
268,"ever, or rather the one he took the most chances with, and may have felt more",UNK
269,comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids & families. The movie has a,UNK
270,kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or,UNK
271,"inconsistencies totally meaningless. Or rather they are part of the fun, and if the movie had",UNK
272,been played seriously it wouldn't have worked -- WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY PETER JACKSON'S MOVIE SUCKED.,UNK

366,"This is one of those Film's/pilot that if you knew BattleStar Galactica it helps, but isn't",UNK
367,necessary. What makes this even more believable of a story than BSG is that this isn't,UNK
368,something so far away in the future. This has such a depth to it that it,UNK
369,is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically. The leads could not have been chosen better,UNK
370,in such experienced & quite talented actors. Eric Stoltz is superb as the father who will,UNK
371,do anything to be re-united w/his daughter however real or not she is & he'll do,UNK

373,"well. You are not sure completely of his motives whether it's love or money or both,",UNK
374,but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing. I see a star in the,UNK
375,making of Zoe played by the relative unknown Alessandra Torresani & her performance. Esai Morales is,UNK
376,terrific in his desire to see his loved one again & just how wrong to be,UNK
377,even considering what he wants more than his moral objections. I didn't think this would be,UNK
378,a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone I am thrilled to,UNK
379,see how we got to the BSG stage story. It's great to see Adama as a,UNK
380,child already being affected & influenced by the different sorts of Robots starting to permeate life,UNK
381,at this stage. I just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can,UNK
382,figure out even more how they got the the Humanoid typed robots. This is an almost,UNK
383,perfect pilot & I hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling. Even the Visual effects,UNK
384,are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. If you haven't,UNK
385,"gotten into BSG, @ least try this & I'll bet you become a fan & will",UNK
386,want to see how the BSG story came to be.,UNK
387,This couldn't have been better. The strong restraints on Mike Sullivan's expressions couldn't have been portrayed,UNK
388,in any other way. Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin,UNK
389,drives an emotional wheel; playing the basis character for the story. And veteran Paul Newman gives,UNK
390,one of his best character performances in a long time. This film is based on a,UNK
391,bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This is a father/son story,UNK
392,which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles. Mike Sullivan had no father,UNK
393,"as a child, so John Rooney took him in. Although a generous man, Mr. Rooney involved",UNK
394,"himself in organized crime. Therefore, the debt of Sullivan was only to be paid off in",UNK
395,"involving himself in the business. Now, Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying",UNK
396,"to keep his children safe, but at the same time pay back his boss. The events",UNK
397,"to follow, will test Sullivan's loyalty and embrace his family's fate. With a great adaptation by",UNK
398,"David Self, the dialogue comes out seldomly, but yet very virtuous. The story unfolds in a",UNK
399,beautiful 1930's setting (Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson & Nancy Haigh) covered with a,UNK
400,"dark rainy (snow on the ground) exterior. Driving the story, is Thomas Newman's wonderful Irish score,",UNK
401,settling in only when necessary. But the most important technical element in the film is Conrad,UNK
402,L. Hall's beautiful photography. This is some of the best cinematography I've seen; and I watch,UNK
403,"a lot of films. The scene when Mike and Michael are in the car, entering Chicago",UNK
404,"is quite impressive. The shot starts at the front of the car, revealing Mike(Hanks) through the",UNK
405,"windshield. It subsequently dollys around to the side of the car, to see Michael(Hoechlin) awakening and",UNK
406,"peering out his side window. As it continues, it trucks sideways and dollys back, completely around",UNK
407,"the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930's Chicago. With a great cast and crew, the",UNK
408,"principle man creates a brazenly amazing film. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his feature",UNK
409,"film debut in 1999 with American Beauty. (won him various awards) Before American Beauty, Mendes worked",UNK
410,"as a play director for the British Theater, but decided that he wanted to move on",UNK
411,"saying that there was nothing new for him in theater. With only two films, Sam Mendes",UNK
412,has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors (In a list of,UNK
413,about twenty-five). The film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses,UNK
414,"the true theme brilliantly. The photography, acting and story is phenominal. I'm still waiting for Scorcesee's",UNK
415,"Gangs of New York, but for now, I'm fully confident in saying that this is the",UNK
416,"""Best Film of the Year"". Considering it's competition (Signs, Insomnia, Minority Report) thats a strong statement.",UNK
417,I was probably one of the few Australians not watching the tennis when this series aired.,UNK
418,"I have to say when William McInnes first appeared I though, that is one crappy actor!",UNK
419,But as the series continued he toned down his performance and I totally loved him. He,UNK
420,was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh. I watched the show to,UNK
421,"see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It",UNK
422,"was interesting to see Speers play a nice, quiet man and even more interesting to watch",UNK
423,"Tom Longs' rippling muscles! Sigh... Seriously, Long's performance was a total shock and really brilliant. He",UNK
424,"stole the show. Martin Sacks was good also in a small role, and the leading actress",UNK
425,put in an entertaining performance. I'd recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist,UNK
426,and watching Tom Long walk around with no shirt on...,UNK
427,My evaluation: 8/10 I like a lot this movie. Compare to today brainless movie (just action,UNK
428,"and special effet and nothing new about ideas), ""Soylent Green"" ask to something that today doesn't",UNK

430,"which are create with body of human. With all what happen on this planet, and to",UNK
431,"see how people are so indifferent to all, this kind of future is possible. Sure this",UNK

433,"other in the hell. Well a luck today they are TV and idiocy like ""Reality Show"".",UNK
434,TV is a good wash brain. It's pity to see that intelligence of human have not,UNK
435,progress like technologies. Since writing all stop. If you like reality show this movie is not,UNK
436,for you. If you believe all politician same too. If you don't like ask yourself question,UNK
437,about now and future well never look this movie.,UNK
438,James Stewart stars in a classic western tale of revenge which ties in with the fate,UNK
439,of the films other star the Winchester Rifle. Stewart is it goes without saying excellent adding,UNK
440,some cold hard obsession to his usual laid back cowboy. The story follows the fate of,UNK
441,a Winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition by our hero and,UNK

447,battle fought at long range in and around a rocky outcrop. Throw in some good old,UNK
448,"western action, fist fights, shootouts and horseback chases it makes for a rollicking western adventure. 8/10",UNK

455,so well done that I wanted to get right on the phone to Paul and let,UNK
456,him know how much I enjoyed it! but I couldn't find his number. Must be unlisted,UNK
457,or something. This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was,UNK
458,going to be about or who was in it or anything. It just came on and,UNK

464,revelations like a bone-crunching blow to the guts. Chilling performance by Edison Chen. The story of,UNK
465,"a HK-Cop and a Cambodian killer hunting each other down, while bit by bit losing their",UNK

468,This is an excellent film for female body-builder & female action fans! I think that Sue,UNK
469,"Price did a great job in this film series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and proved to be a",UNK

471,powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Though not a film of great value and Sue Price's acting skills,UNK
472,"not the best to have met in my life, the movie itself was something awesome, a",UNK
473,"priceless gem for fans of female body-builder action! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been",UNK
474,"copied by other famous sci-fi films, such as Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point.",UNK
475,The point is that A.Puyn casted in that film a very talented body-builder who put all,UNK
476,of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do. I really,UNK
477,enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (a rather boring sequel) and,UNK
478,Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a pity it hasn't shown yet,UNK
479,on DVD :-(,UNK
480,This is a great movie that I don't think gets enough credit as Saturday Night Fever,UNK
481,or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a,UNK
482,"girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. Instead, he wants to",UNK
483,engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. Even though it,UNK
484,"was made in 1980, it is still timely today. The great country music soundtrack is terrific.",UNK
485,10/10,UNK
486,One of the best love stories I have ever seen. It is a bit like watching,UNK

492,Thanks should be given to the Hong Kong VCD/DVD distributors that I only paid US$1.4 and,UNK
493,I could have such a surprisingly delightful enjoyment. Adultery? How common in our modern days. Eva,UNK
494,grabbed her two children and kidnapped Nick to chase after Luis and Charlotte to Italy. She,UNK
495,"wants her revenge done but at the end, she also commits the same crime of Luis:",UNK
496,"she had sex with Nick. In this small indie production, Vivian Naefe dealt with the teething",UNK
497,problems in modern marriage with a light heart. How can one dare treat marriage seriously in,UNK
498,"this fast-food time where people are now of higher mobility in physical, mental and technology areas?",UNK
499,Conjugal commitment asks for too high a price that most people would choose to succumb to,UNK
500,circumstances. Nick once trusted Charlotte but he fell for Eva after that kidnap journey which forced,UNK
501,him to experience much growth. Most viewers may feel happy about the ending because Eva and,UNK
502,"Nick come together, well, this should be the greatest retribution to the unfaithful act of their",UNK
503,"spouses. However, I want a sequel, I want to see how the four would develop after",UNK
504,"this exchange. Perhaps they may exchange back, how can one be so sure about the shaky",UNK
505,love relationship. Good acting and good scenery. The two little child-actors should not be neglected especially,UNK
506,"the boy when he cries at the reception of the hotel in Venezia. And of course,",UNK
507,"how can we forget the ""bella, bella"" scenery of the city.",UNK
508,"Mesmerizing, breathtaking and horrifying, this hauntingly beautiful film is the ""Apocalypse Now"" without fiction. Slow in",UNK
509,"pace, quiet in mood, it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of Earth that may",UNK
510,well be signs of an inevitable doom. There is no doubt in my mind -- the,UNK
511,"nature is plagued and we are the disease. Greed, the very essence of humanity that drives",UNK
512,"evolution and progress, has turned us into something like cancer, on its way to consume the",UNK

515,"I have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel ""Jane",UNK
516,"Eyre"". Both Dalton and Clarke are very believable as Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions,",UNK
517,but none compare to this one. The best one for me. I could never imagine anyone,UNK

521,any of the episodes. I'd like to see it again because it's so good. :-),UNK
522,"At first glance, it would seem natural to compare Where the Sidewalk Ends with Laura. Both",UNK
523,"have noirish qualities, both were directed by Otto Preminger, and both star Dana Andrews and Gene",UNK
524,"Tierney. But that's where most of the comparisons end. Laura dealt with posh, sophisticated people with",UNK
525,means who just happen to find themselves mixed-up in a murder. Where the Sidewalk Ends is,UNK
526,set in a completely different strata. These are people with barely two nickels to rub together,UNK
527,who are more accustomed to seeing the underbelly of society than going to fancy dress parties.,UNK
528,Where the Sidewalk ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems,UNK
529,with their fists or some other weapon. Small-time hoods are a dime-a-dozen and cops routinely beat,UNK
530,confessions out of the crooks. Getting caught-up in a murder investigation seems as natural as breathing.,UNK
531,"While I haven't seen his entire body of work, based on what I have seen, Dana",UNK
532,"Andrews gives one of his best performances as the beat-down cop, Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon. He's",UNK
533,the kind of cop who is used to roughing up the local hoods if it gets,UNK
534,"him information or a confession. One night, he goes too far and accidentally kills a man.",UNK
535,He does his best to cover it up. But things get complicated when he falls for,UNK
536,"the dead man's wife, Morgan Taylor (Tierney), whose father becomes suspect number one in the murder",UNK
537,"case. As Morgan's father means the world to her, Dixon's got to do what he can",UNK
538,"to clear the old man without implicating himself. Technically, Where the Sidewalk Ends is outstanding. Besides",UNK
539,"the terrific performance from Andrews, the movie features the always delightful Tierney. She has a quality",UNK
540,that can make even the bleakest of moments seem brighter. The rest of the cast is,UNK
541,just as solid with Tom Tully as the wrongly accused father being a real standout. Beyond,UNK
542,"the acting, the direction, sets, lighting, and cinematography are all top-notch. Overall, it's an amazingly well",UNK
543,"made film. If I have one complaint (and admittedly it's a very, very minor quibble) it's",UNK
544,that Tierney is almost too perfect for the role and her surroundings. It's a little difficult,UNK
545,to believe that a woman like that could find herself mixed-up with some of these unsavory,UNK
546,"characters. It's not really her fault, it's just the way Tierney comes across. She seems a",UNK
547,"little too beautiful, polished, and delicate for the part. But, her gentle, kind, trusting nature add",UNK
548,a sense of needed realism to her portrayal.,UNK
549,"`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a well-crafted, surprisingly spooky entry from Italian director",UNK
550,"Anthony Dawson. Exquisite black and white cinematography, flawless dubbing, superb casting, fairly logical scripting, deliberate pacing",UNK
551,and a surprise (though totally appropriate) ending set this one apart. Only the films sometimes hokey,UNK
552,music and the rather abrupt `love at first sight' between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges,UNK
553,"Rivière) mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie. While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a",UNK
554,"pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a",UNK
555,"young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals",UNK
556,"that all of his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death.",UNK
557,Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's,UNK
558,"castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan cannot afford the bet, so he",UNK
559,"bets his life for a 10 pound wager. Unlike Mario Bava's overpraised `Black Sunday,' (aka `The",UNK
560,"Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' is fairly restrained, making the few moments of violence even",UNK
561,"more dreadful, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from",UNK
562,the 60s. It's a pity the only version of this film I've found is badly deteriorated,UNK
563,"(and recorded) pan and scan version. Even so, it is well worth seeing, and cries out",UNK
564,"for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of",UNK
565,Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with Robert Wise's `The Haunting'.,UNK
566,Cuban Blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life,UNK
567,in a very traditional way. I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western,UNK
568,Caribbean cruise. It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town,UNK
569,in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is spent on the,UNK
570,"revolution until the very end, when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the",UNK

572,that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes,UNK
573,that everyone can relate to. A class A film with fine acting and directing. This is,UNK
574,a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists.,UNK
575,"It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their triumphs. A good",UNK
576,film worth watching several times annually.,UNK
577,"Henri Verneuil's film may be not so famous as Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor",UNK
578,or JFK but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives,UNK
579,of the genre. Action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed.,UNK
580,"After several years of investigation, special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone",UNK
581,"gunman. But one man - prosecutor Volney, played by Yves Montand - thinks there's something more",UNK
582,"to be investigated and so the film starts. This movie doesn't deal with some exact theories,",UNK
583,but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in today's world. Such,UNK
584,"film could be made only in the 1970-ies but it will never lose it's actuality. Furthermore,",UNK
585,it's even a bit frightful how precise are it's oracles. 10 out of 10.,UNK
586,Did you ever wonder how far one movie could go? Schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world of,UNK
587,"the extreme with Harry Russo. Harry is an aggravated writer, killer and drug addict scumbag who",UNK
588,will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and insanity. Driven by the,UNK
589,"demonic voices of his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck, Harry begins his killing spree. From director Ron Atkins",UNK
590,comes the 1st installment of the vilest story ever to be filmed The only other movie,UNK
591,I have seen similar to this would happen to be the 2nd installment entitled Schizophreniac Necromaniac,UNK
592,"This is a really low budget film and will not be for everyone, but if you",UNK
593,"are looking for something disturbing, different and horrific then this would make a fine choice. DO",UNK
594,NOT EXPECT ANYTHING LIKE MODERN DAY HORROR (Such as Scream) Viewer discretion is advised,UNK
595,"As a long-standing Barbra fan, any posting like this will be biased. That aside, this film",UNK
596,"ranks as a classic. It has it's flaws (emphasized in other postings), but gives a glimpse",UNK
597,"of a time (late 70s) that will never be there again, and is fascinating to watch",UNK
598,unfold on screen. Streisand fought hard to make this movie her own. I don't think she,UNK
599,was ever satisfied. But it gives her fans a new Barbra (for the time) with LIVE,UNK
600,"singing, a young fresh appearance, and some very heavy-duty acting. The story is rough, but exciting,",UNK
601,"and holds your interest throughout. The extended one frame ""finale"" is hard for most non-Barbra fans",UNK
602,"to sit through, but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent.",UNK
603,I happen to run into this movie one night so I decided to watch it! I,UNK
604,was very pleased with the movie... I thought it was a wonderful plot. It's a great,UNK
605,feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say,UNK
606,what you want to say! And this wife stayed devoted for 23 years!!! I thought it,UNK
607,was a great movie!!,UNK
608,I realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play,UNK
609,"on words into its title. This movie is not primarily about the act of ""riding giants,""",UNK
610,"but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, RIDING giants, to change",UNK
611,"the emphasis. In my teens I lived a block from the Wedge, one of the hardest-breaking",UNK
612,"and best bodysurfing spots in the world. I've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf, and have",UNK
613,ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. That experience is why,UNK
614,"I am in complete awe of the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark,",UNK
615,"to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding Maverick's BY HIMSELF for over",UNK
616,"a decade is beyond my grasp. The first safety rule of any water sport is ""Never",UNK
617,"surf/dive/swim by yourself."" He went where sane people would not, and lived to tell about it.",UNK
618,I wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left.,UNK
619,In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves at Jaws always makes,UNK
620,"the skin tingle over my entire body. These are not just scary waves, these are uncontrolled-bowel-evacuation",UNK
621,waves. When we see Laird Hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves (I can hardly type,UNK
622,"those numbers), but actually working the faces like a fun day at Rincon, I'm blown away.",UNK
623,There is a dedication and focus in big-wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone,UNK
624,in the world. This a great film. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10,UNK
625,only because it neglects to mention that there are great big-wave riders in the world outside,UNK
626,"the Hamilton/Kalama crew, and I think they deserved mention. Splice in Ken Bradshaw at outside Log",UNK
627,Cabins and a 10 it is!,UNK
628,I am writing this after just seeing The Perfect Son at the 2002 Gay and Lesbian,UNK
629,"Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia. When their Father dies, two estranged brothers meet at",UNK
630,"the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from AIDS, they enter",UNK
631,on a heart warming journey of reconciliation. The two leads do a magnificent job of creating,UNK
632,the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses. I do,UNK
633,"have one qualm about the movie though - whilst the brother who is dying acts sick,",UNK
634,he doesn't look it. A person of 0 T4 cells would look quite ill - not,UNK
635,"even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed. A small gripe,",UNK
636,"but one that makes it a bit less realistic. Despite that one small gripe, The Perfect",UNK
637,Son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it- do. I'm,UNK
638,hoping for a DVD release in the near future!,UNK
639,The premise of the story is simple: An old man living alone in the woods accidentally,UNK
640,"stumble upon a murder of a small child, and tries to convince the police that the",UNK
641,"murder has occurred. Though very little dialog is provided throughout the film, the visual narrative told",UNK
642,by the camera's eye alone made the film quite engaging. The setting of the gray woods,UNK
643,"conveys a feeling of loneliness, which complements the quietness of the characters themselves. We can also",UNK
644,"sense helplessness in the old man's inability to convince the police of the murder, which parallels",UNK
645,"the silenced child's inability to tell her own story. True horror lies in feelings of hopelessness,",UNK
646,"helplessness, and irrationality. This film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone, rather than relying on",UNK
647,cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative,UNK
648,"is weak. Cleverly, the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a",UNK
649,few creepy and startling moments. The ending is also unexpected and believable. Reminiscent of Japanese horror,UNK
650,"films, such as ""The Ring,"" and ""Dark Water,"" or English horror films, such as ""Lady in",UNK
651,"Black,"" and ""The Innocents,"" this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror. I recommend",UNK
652,anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a try.,UNK
653,"By the way, if you haven't seen the films I just mentioned above, you might want",UNK
654,to give them a try as well.,UNK
655,I saw this film a while back and it's still at the top of my 'favorite,UNK
656,movies' list. It is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed,UNK
657,tid bits (such as the 'Cafe Bustelo' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash,UNK
658,her grandsons hair) that people aren't seeing because YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU,UNK
659,ARE HISPANIC. This is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular.,UNK
660,Please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's,UNK
661,"being built upon. I completely see what the writer/director was going for, and he hit the",UNK
662,target perfectly! This film is highly deserving of a better rating.,UNK
663,I work with children from 0  6 years old and they all love the Doodlebops.,UNK
664,"The Doodlebops are energetic, vibrant and appealing. Once they start singing, ''We're the Doodlebops We're the",UNK
665,Doodlebops We're the Doodlebops Oh yeah Come and join the fun because we're laughing and we're,UNK
666,"singing all day"" it is almost impossible not to join them in song. The Doodlebops brings",UNK
667,"the viewer into a world of color and fun. Each show is an adventure, the Doodlebops",UNK
668,do not try to change the world with preachy messages all they do is have fun,UNK
669,while sorting out everyday life challenges that the young child may relate to. The Doodlebops is,UNK
670,"an refreshing, high action alternative to regular children's television programs.",UNK
671,this independent film was one of the best films at the tall grass film festival that,UNK
672,i have ever seen there i loved it there are so many things that was great,UNK
673,about the film on top of all that the cast and crew that i had the,UNK
674,opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenal.I thought that Avi did a great job in his role.,UNK
675,and Ricky Ullman was absolutely true to his role for a Disney actor i was amazed,UNK
676,at his talent to be able to go from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult,UNK
677,role with no problems the talent in the film was just amazing the cinematography was just,UNK
678,great if you want to see an independent film this is one really that you should,UNK
679,see.I think that Mr Gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission in,UNK
680,his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience favorite,UNK
681,they went and saw it again. this truly was a great film it was dark and,UNK
682,funny and sad and truly emotional it was just fabulous. I am honestly just so enthused,UNK
683,by this film and i really don't want to spoil it for any one just see,UNK
684,it and truly be amazed at it i think that these film makers really have what,UNK
685,it takes to go places and I hope to see more work from them in the,UNK
686,future.,UNK
687,"To make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about Kip (Giovanni Ribsi),",UNK
688,"a car thief, who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars (50 in total). He",UNK
689,is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the order'. The objective,UNK
690,"now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days, with the help of Randall (Nicolas",UNK
691,"Cage), a retired' booster and also Kip's brother and a couple of old friends of Randall's.",UNK
692,"As you can see this is the same old, big bro' needs to get lil' bro'",UNK
693,out of trouble routine and of course Randall is the best thief there ever was. Of,UNK
694,course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never,UNK
695,"would have thought of, but at times it is predictable too, so there is nothing fancy",UNK
696,about the story. You are by now probably wondering why this is about 51 times the,UNK
697,"HOT STUFF, since there are only 50 beautiful, fast, cool and expensive cars to be stolen.",UNK
698,Well the other hot item in this film is Sway (Angelina Jolie (who will be a,UNK
699,big STAR (trust me))). She is not only very convincing in the role as a car,UNK
700,"theft, but she is pretty hot too. OK not hot as in pretty, but hot as",UNK
701,"in damn cool and sexy. She was very believable in this role, probably because she is",UNK
702,"some kind of a wild woman in real life too (don't believe me, read her biography)",UNK
703,"and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man. I only know, that she",UNK
704,"plays the kind of girl I like in this film, because she is not too mainstream,",UNK
705,a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo. OK the only downsides I,UNK
706,"felt while watching this movie was, that there is not very much action, there is one",UNK
707,"totally unrealistic scene, the story is only OK and that there are not much jokes. Hey",UNK
708,"but after seeing the whole film I must say: WHO CARES. Why must I say that,",UNK
709,well because it was still entertaining; had a couple of cool car chases; good music; some,UNK
710,Bruckheimer scenes (where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go,UNK
711,"wet); good actors who all did their jobs; pretty cars; one cool, wild, sexy lady (yes,",UNK
712,I mean Mrs. Jolie) and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost,UNK
713,the cars with. So some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie. All,UNK
714,in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall OK,UNK
715,"movie with a cool  feelgood ending. As for Nicolas Cage, well He is actually one",UNK
716,of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as The,UNK
717,"Rock, Con Air, Face / Off, Snake Eyes and finally this one. Plus what actor has",UNK
718,had so many good action / thriller's in the last years and such successful ones ?,UNK
719,"Well no one!!! Maybe Jackie Chan, but he is one of my favourites too. One thing",UNK
720,that is true though about Mr. Cages Bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse. The,UNK
721,"Rock, was a clear 9, Con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly",UNK
722,is a 7. Not that that mark is bad. Does it not show that his films,UNK
723,under Bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe Cage has to think longer before he accepts,UNK
724,a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ? No,UNK
725,"it doesn't show us that, because almost all of Cage's films were successful in the last",UNK
726,"few years, except for 8mm and Bringing out the Dead. 8mm was not great, I admit",UNK
727,"that, but that was never Cage's fault and the story seemed good to me. About the",UNK
728,"latter film I can not say anything, cause I have not seen it yet. One thing",UNK
729,"though I know for sure, if Bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films, I",UNK
730,"would have said YES to all of them. I would have said yes to The Rock,",UNK
731,because the story was great and because you would get to play with Sean Connery and,UNK
732,"Ed Harris. I would have said yes to Con Air, because there would be a lot",UNK
733,"of action in it, because the story was good and because you got to act with",UNK
734,John Malkovich and Ving Rhames. In this one I would have starred because I would have,UNK
735,"gotten a big paycheque, I would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars",UNK
736,and because I would have been able to kiss Angelina Jolie (can't wait to see her,UNK
737,in that Lara Croft outfit). This one was a good choice of Mr. Cage and it,UNK
738,certainly was worth a look at in the theatre. 7 out of 10,UNK
739,FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF film from the golden age of SF cinema and what,UNK
740,makes it a great film is its sense of wonder . As soon as the spaceship,UNK
741,lands the audience - via the ships human crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes,UNK
742,"terrifying adventure . We meet the unforgetable Robbie , the mysterious Dr Morbuis , his beautiful",UNK
743,and innocent daughter Altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - The,UNK
744,Krell who died out overnight . Or did they ? You can nitpick and say the,UNK
745,planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a,UNK
746,sense of menace of claustraphobia I feel and Bebe and Louis Barron`s electronic music adds even,UNK
747,more atmosphere I`m shocked this film isn`t in the top 250 IMDB films .,UNK
748,"Halfway through Lajos Koltai's ""Evening,"" a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her",UNK
749,"hallucination: ""Can you tell me where my life went?"" The line could be embarrassingly theatrical, but",UNK
750,"the woman speaking it is Vanessa Redgrave, delivering it with utter simplicity, and the question tears",UNK
751,"your heart out. Time and again, the film based on Susan Minot's novel skirts sentimentality and",UNK
752,"ordinariness, it holds attention, offers admirable performances, and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have.",UNK
753,"With only six months of the year gone, there are now two memorable, meaningful, worthwhile films",UNK
754,"in theaters, the other, of course, being Sara Polley's ""Away from Her."" Hollywood might have turned",UNK
755,"""Evening"" into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters -",UNK
756,"Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is Redgrave's daughter in",UNK
757,"the film (with a sister played by Tony Collette), and Gummer plays Streep's younger self, while",UNK
758,"Redgrave's youthful incarnation is Claire Danes. Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson, and",UNK
759,"a large cast - yes, it could have turned into a multiple star platform. Instead, Koltai",UNK

762,"days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with trouble. Missed connections, wrong choices, and",UNK
763,"dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera, but the quality of",UNK
764,"the writing, Koltai's direction, and selfless acting raise ""Evening"" way above that level, into the the",UNK
765,"rarified air of English, French (and a few American) family sagas from a century before its",UNK
766,"contemporary setting. Complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of",UNK
767,"a difficult triangle all come across clearly, understandably, captivatingly. Individual tunes are woven into a symphony.",UNK
768,"And yet, with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances, the stars of",UNK
769,"""Evening"" still shine through, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (an exciting new discovery, looking vaguely like her mother,",UNK
770,"but a very different actress), Danes carrying most of the load - until Streep shows up",UNK
771,"in the final moments and, of course, steals the show. Dancy and Wilson are well worth",UNK
772,"the price of admission too. As with ""Away from Her,"" ""Evening"" stays with you at length,",UNK
773,"inviting a re-thinking its story and characters, and re-experiencing the emotions it raises. At two hours,",UNK
774,"the film runs a bit long, but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome",UNK
775,among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn.,UNK
776,"I sit through movies like ""Tiempo de valientes"" and I want to talk about cinema for",UNK
777,"hours. The admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation, because I'm",UNK
778,watching the scenes of the film and I search inside my thoughts for film-making ideas and,UNK
779,"dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than Damian Szifron's mind. Looking the environment, so",UNK
780,"uncompromised, so simple, I'm thinking; this man is a genius. No wonder he created what is",UNK
781,"probably the best television show Argentina ever witnessed, and then a first movie full of elements",UNK
782,"some contemporary directors haven't still achieved. ""El fondo del mar"" is the name and, it awakened",UNK
783,"(a few years ago), my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema. Starting his journey from people's daily",UNK
784,"real lives, Szifron goes where Pablo Trapero never could in ""El Bonaerense""; the Federal Police Department's",UNK
785,"life. Trapero's film was a journey into a man's mind and experiences, not into the places",UNK
786,"he saw. Yes, there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations, but Szifron in",UNK
787,"""in there"", his is more of a detective story, like the ones we know and love,",UNK
788,"with the mysteries and the thrilling music. But there's a lot of humanity in his writing,",UNK
789,"and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters, Alfredo Díaz and",UNK
790,"Mariano Silverstein. There are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film, but these",UNK
791,two actors are the ones the film can't do without. The first character (Luis Luque) is,UNK
792,a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him; and has to work,UNK
793,on a case. The second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the,UNK
794,detective. He wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of,UNK
795,"the time disposition and suggests he joins Díaz in his routines: ""It's nothing, the usual stuff;",UNK
796,"no problem"". But it is bigger than that, and it will unfold a part of the",UNK
797,doctor's personality he didn't know. The relationship developed between the two leads can't be explained unless,UNK
798,"it is observed, because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men",UNK
799,"like Szifron that are trying, today, to leave a signature in our history. Reaching points of",UNK
800,"unbelievable spontaneity, during a high pressure situation, Díaz tells Silverstein: ""How do we continue our treatment?"",",UNK
801,"and Silverstein answers: ""No, I'm not your doctor. You call me to have dinner; I'm your",UNK
802,"friend"": we laugh because we can't help it. And we can't help laughing when Díaz crashes",UNK
803,"a car in the street and doesn't gives importance to it, or when he trespasses all",UNK
804,"the red lights in the street, or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and",UNK
805,Silverstein can't believe it (but then smokes it too because he's screwed up); or when Silverstein,UNK
806,tries to be friendly with Díaz's robber friends. Magic from Diego Peretti is what we receive,UNK
807,"there. He, a psychiatrist himself, gives a performance in plan ""Locas de amor"", but impresses with",UNK
808,"all his range. Luis Luque on the other hand, is back on track with a top-notch",UNK
809,"portrayal that reminds us the great actor he is. There's a passion I have for this,",UNK
810,"and as I said, I could write about it for hours, but unfortunately that's not the",UNK
811,way it works and I have to be precise and summarize. Although I have to watch,UNK
812,"a lot of the old movies and study them, I could assure that ""Tiempo de valientes""",UNK
813,is the comedy Argentina had been waiting for and never got Until now.,UNK

819,"look at. Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer are a superb screen couple. She is, to put",UNK
820,"it simply, gorgeous, and Boyer gives a most effective, understated performance, letting his sensitive face do",UNK
821,"much of his acting for him. The supporting cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a sympathetic",UNK
822,"role as a Count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly, talkative guide (all",UNK
823,"the ""Arabic"" he & others speak in the film is pure gibberish); Lucile Watson as a",UNK
824,gentle Mother Superior; Alan Marshal as an honorable young French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous,UNK
825,dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic porter; John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner; and magnificent,UNK
826,Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest. Movie mavens will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy,UNK
827,as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones & Bonita Granville (peeking over the nun's shoulder) as convent,UNK
828,"girls; gaunt Nigel De Brulier as a monastery lector; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel clerk,",UNK
829,"all uncredited. Color films of the 1930's are both rare & lovely to look at, and",UNK
830,this movie is no exception - the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. THE,UNK

835,film was shot on a Hollywood sound stage.,UNK
836,An excellent documentry. I personally remember this growing up in NYC in the early 80's. This,UNK
837,movie is for anyone that wasn't around during that time period.This shows the one thing the,UNK

1476,This was no Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie film. It was a big wannabee. It wanted to,UNK
1477,"be an edgy, nervous-laughter, urban-life affirming film, but it's more of a camera jerky, mess. It's",UNK

1479,"From the beginning, I couldn't care less about the characters or what they were involved in.",UNK
1480,"They were always always hitting, pissing, or crying on each other. Only, there wasn't any substance",UNK

1482,"it comes out trite, and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are viewers",UNK
1483,"out there that really liked this movie, so I could be wrong.",UNK
1484,The movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument,UNK
1485,against the death penalty on any level. By presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder,UNK
1486,as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to,UNK
1487,"the status of martyr for Christ. Somehow, according to the plot, god is outraged that society",UNK
1488,has chosen to rid it's self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting,UNK
1489,them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds. Yet this same god has no,UNK
1490,"indignation for the acts of the killer. The lead character, an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman, ultimately",UNK

1492,In other threads of the underdeveloped plot Jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond,UNK
1493,to symbolically unleash the wrath of God. The modern lackluster incarnation of Christ not just dehumanizes,UNK
1494,him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well. He is unable to affect,UNK
1495,humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it's,UNK
1496,"self. Meanwhile, with little help from Jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the",UNK
1497,ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind,UNK
1498,from the wrath of the almighty. I also interpreted that as a statement in support of,UNK
1499,abortion on some levels. This movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller,UNK
1500,fails to make any religious point that I could clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs.,UNK
1501,It raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer. It disregards the religious values,UNK

1505,"with earnest themes like humanity, and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance. But in spite",UNK
1506,"of its honourable intentions and its well-meaning tone, Skullduggery simply isn't a very good film. For",UNK
1507,"me, the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can't make its mind up how",UNK
1508,best to convey its message. The first half of the movie is like watching a standard,UNK
1509,jungle expedition flick of the Tarzan ilk; later it teeters into sci-fi fable; by the end,UNK
1510,it slips into courtroom melodramatics. The differences in tone between each section of the movie are,UNK
1511,"too great, too jarring, to overlook. They stick out like a sore thumb and remind you",UNK
1512,"constantly that you're watching a muddled, disorganised movie. An archaeological expedition into the jungles of New",UNK
1513,Guinea is led by adventurer Douglas Temple (Burt Reynolds). One of the main archaeologists involved in,UNK
1514,the excursion is attractive lady scientist Dr Sybil Greame (Susan Clark). After an arduous trek they,UNK
1515,"stumble upon a tribe of strange ape-like creatures. These primitive, long-lost people are covered in hair",UNK
1516,and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments,UNK
1517,of modern man. There is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man ,UNK

1519,who simply look and behave differently from usual? Or even a race of animals that have,UNK
1520,"begun to develop human characteristics? The archaeologists call the tribe ""the Tropi"" and are initially thrilled",UNK
1521,by the implications of their discovery. But things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist Vancruysen,UNK
1522,(Paul Hubschmid) declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers.,UNK

1528,a charming adventurer who really belongs in a Tarzan flick. His character and the film are,UNK
1529,"not relevant to each other. Clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist, and there",UNK
1530,"are nice supporting roles for British actors Edward Fox, Alexander Knox and Wilfrid Hyde-White. A major",UNK
1531,shortcoming in Skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make-up used to give the Tropi their strange,UNK
1532,"hairy appearance. Rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids, the stuck-on hair merely makes",UNK
1533,them look unintentionally comical . and that's just not the right idea. We're meant to feel,UNK
1534,"great sympathy for these creatures, but that's awfully hard when they look so unconvincing. Skullduggery is",UNK

1541,"10+ minutes in advance. There was no subtlety to anything the movie did, no intelligence evident",UNK
1542,at all behind the scenes. Every spoken or typed line's intent was so glaringly obvious it,UNK

1546,"By rights, there should never have been a ""First Blood Part II"". The original script for",UNK
1547,"""First Blood"" had John Rambo committing suicide at the end of the film, but this was",UNK
1548,"changed to allow him to live, not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but",UNK
1549,"because test audiences found the original ending too depressing. Nevertheless, someone obviously thought that the character",UNK
1550,"was too good to waste, because he ended up as the hero of two more films",UNK
1551,"in the eighties, plus the recently released fourth instalment. The official title of this film was",UNK
1552,"""Rambo: First Blood Part II"", but it is more commonly known simply as ""Rambo"". It starts",UNK
1553,"with the title character in jail, where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in",UNK
1554,"""First Blood"", although this is never made too explicit. He is removed from prison by his",UNK
1555,"former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman, for a secret mission. Rambo is to return to Vietnam to",UNK
1556,investigate reports that American POWs are still being held captive by the Communist regime. He is,UNK
1557,under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy; his,UNK
1558,is to be simply a fact-finding mission. What Rambo does not realise is that he is,UNK
1559,"being set up, not by Trautman, who is portrayed as brave, honourable and incorruptible, but by",UNK
1560,"the organiser of the mission, a military bureaucrat named Murdock. Murdock intends that the mission will",UNK
1561,"prove that there are no American prisoners in Vietnam, partly because that will improve relationships between",UNK
1562,"the American and Vietnamese governments, partly because it will make his own life easier. Unfortunately for",UNK
1563,"Murdock, Rambo discovers that not only are Americans still being held prisoner, they are also being",UNK
1564,"kept in hellish conditions. Of course, he is far too much of a hero to leave",UNK
1565,"them to their fate, and tries to rescue them. The rest of the film is more",UNK
1566,or less one long battle between Rambo and a few allies (including a beautiful Vietnamese girl),UNK
1567,"and the evil commie soldiers and their Russian allies. Most of the evil commies, of course,",UNK
1568,"end up dead, although I was surprised to learn from your ""trivia"" section that the total",UNK
1569,death toll was as low as 67. At times it seemed as though Rambo was trying,UNK
1570,to wipe out the entire Vietnamese army. The tone of this film is very different from,UNK
1571,"the first. In ""First Blood"" Rambo was unquestionably a criminal, even though his responsibility for his",UNK
1572,"crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability. In ""Rambo"" he is a",UNK
1573,"bona fide all-American hero. A few years earlier the director, George Pan Cosmatos, had made ""The",UNK
1574,"Cassandra Crossing"", a biased piece of left-wing anti-American propaganda. Cosmatos, however, was nothing if not versatile,",UNK
1575,"and ""Rambo"" proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right-wing pro-American propaganda. The",UNK
1576,"one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad. ""First Blood""",UNK
1577,"had its faults, but it also had its virtues. Its stance, that the anti-war movement was",UNK
1578,"partly to blame for the problems faced by Vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life, was",UNK
1579,"a controversial one, but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war,",UNK
1580,"social attitudes to war, and the roots of violence in society. ""Rambo"", by contrast, has very",UNK
1581,"few virtues, except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like",UNK
1582,that sort of thing. It is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those Americans,UNK
1583,"who were still sore about the Vietnam war. Rambo re-fights the war single-handed, and this time",UNK
1584,"the right side wins. Take that, Charlie Cong! By this point, no doubt, the film's admirers",UNK
1585,"(and there seem to be plenty- more than 2,000 voters have already given it ten stars)",UNK
1586,"will have concluded that I am a liberal commie-loving pinko. Far from it- in fact, I",UNK
1587,have always despised Communism as a pernicious ideology. What I dislike about the film is not,UNK
1588,"its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems,",UNK
1589,"including ideological disputes, is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill",UNK
1590,as many people as possible. It makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of South-East,UNK
1591,"Asia or why not everyone in the region was pro-American. For all its anti-Communism, the film",UNK
1592,is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the Communists were very good at churning out,UNK
1593,"themselves- except that they attributed all the world's problems to Capitalism, or Imperialism, or Revisionism, or",UNK
1594,"whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to. Compared to ""Rambo"", ""The Green Berets"" was",UNK
1595,a masterly piece of political analysis. 3/10,UNK
1596,I can just about understand why some people might wish to stress this film's link with,UNK
1597,the Eighties but I really wouldn't say it's an accurate depiction of most peoples' lives in,UNK
1598,that era - even on the poorest Bradford estates. It is however typical of the blunt,UNK
1599,agitprop rubbish the dear old Royal Court Theatre was churning out at that time. Plenty of,UNK
1600,"'right-on' artistry for small, small audiences but enough well-connected backslapping to ensure future commissions for turgid",UNK
1601,playrights. IThe simple fact is that if you want to reflect upon truer common experience you'll,UNK
1602,find millions more nodding in knowing agreement to love and live as depicted in 'Gregory's Girl'.,UNK
1603,I would be tempted to call this a 'kitchen sink' drama but that would be doing,UNK
1604,"a great disservice to the plumbing industry. However, as far as having a decent script is",UNK
1605,"concerned, this film is indeed all washed up. For some reason it has accrued an odd",UNK
1606,following amongst Guardian reading film-goers - I can only assume they get a visual frisson out,UNK
1607,of pretending to slum it. Steer clear my friends. It is a poor film with a,UNK
1608,poor script that likes to think it is breaking boundaries by adding humorous insights into grim,UNK
1609,life on the estates. it isn't..but it is grim. Do the washing up instead.,UNK
1610,"MINOR SPOILERS! Well i just sat up late and watched this film, mainly because i enjoyed",UNK
1611,"and rated some of Singleton's earlier work like ""Boyz n the hood"". However, i have to",UNK
1612,"say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived, clichéd, so-called ""message""",UNK
1613,"movies. The acting is mainly poor,(pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors...take note),",UNK
1614,"the situations hard to swallow, (rape victim becomes overnight lesbian?...please!), but worst of all it reinforces",UNK
1615,every screwed up stereotype you can think of. By the second half of the film it,UNK
1616,"has become cartoon like in its characterisation, making you lose any shred of empathy you may",UNK
1617,have had for its one-dimensional players. Not once is any valid point made about the inherent,UNK
1618,"causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result it merely ends up",UNK
1619,"sensationalising the results of these problems. It's message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion",UNK
1620,"and a general lack of plot cohesion. As for the films conclusion i found it predictable,",UNK
1621,"embarrassing, exploitative and mildly offensive. For a film called ""Higher Learning"" i have to say all",UNK
1622,i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again. If you want a true comment on,UNK
1623,"some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire ""American",UNK
1624,"History X""....unless you were just watching it for Tyra Banks then go hire a life.",UNK
1625,The original exploitation classic-though far from enjoyable on almost any level concerning some guys who turn,UNK
1626,cats into human flesh eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people,UNK
1627,is remade with scifi elements added. The cats can't get enough and when the flesh tainted,UNK
1628,food runs out the cats turn on their owners. Poorly put together on almost every level,UNK
1629,this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to actually,UNK
1630,play movie theaters in the early 1970's updated with alien cat and dog races battling for,UNK
1631,"supremacy. Director Ted Mikel is a hack, but is so lovable a person (I generally like",UNK
1632,the guy thanks to his smile inducing interviews and commentary tracks) that you can pretty much,UNK
1633,excuse the garbage he mostly turned out. Mikels wanted to make films and he didn't care,UNK
1634,"how they turned out so long as he was producing something. More power to him, but",UNK
1635,I wish he wouldn't subject us to his home movies,UNK
1636,Great cast. Great acting. Unpredictable story line for the first half hour or so. I was,UNK
1637,"really wanting to know what was going to happen to each of these unredeeming characters, and",UNK
1638,how their seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined. But when the writers took out the glue,UNK
1639,"to start connecting the players, they mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a",UNK
1640,"standstill for the last two hours. I kept thinking it would get better, but it only",UNK
1641,got worse. Don't believe the reviews. This is a waste of time. Think about it --,UNK
1642,Tom Cruise made ugly -- why? The gorgeous hunky bartender wearing braces -- why? I know,UNK
1643,"it had to do with the plot, but without them, at least there would have been",UNK
1644,one attractive cast member to remember.,UNK
1645,"There are many different versions of this one floating around, so make sure you can locate",UNK
1646,"one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing.",UNK
1647,Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The,UNK
1648,"cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show,",UNK
1649,who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release. It's a nice-looking print,UNK
1650,"and seems to have all of the footage, but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues. In Italy,",UNK
1651,it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA releases were actually,UNK
1652,the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film by,UNK
1653,"the same production company (Filmirage), which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make",UNK
1654,"matters even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where",UNK
1655,"GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, I better just shut up now. I'm",UNK
1656,"starting to confuse myself! Regardless of the title, this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort. Some",UNK
1657,"of it is good, some of it isn't. I actually was into this film for the",UNK
1658,"first half or so, but toward the end it became a senseless mess. A large, vacant",UNK
1659,"hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting, as various people",UNK
1660,"get picked off one-by-one by a German- speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who",UNK
1661,"wants to capture ""Witch Light,"" and his virginal writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying witchcraft,",UNK
1662,"are shacking up at the hotel without permission. Along comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth),",UNK
1663,who's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks.,UNK
1664,Also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son,UNK
1665,"Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at",UNK
1666,"the time). Once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears,",UNK
1667,"so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the ""Lady in Black."" So",UNK
1668,what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their,UNK
1669,lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by,UNK
1670,"the rest of the cast. There's also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish",UNK
1671,"through the head, someone set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street tape recorder, the virgin",UNK
1672,"getting raped by some demon, a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes",UNK
1673,"and some other stuff. From a technical standpoint, it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography,",UNK
1674,a decent score and good gore effects. The hotel/island setting is also pretty nice. Blair (particularly,UNK
1675,at the end) and Ross both seem like they're having fun and Knef is great as,UNK
1676,"the evil witch. Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in",UNK
1677,"his role, either. On the down side, despite all the gore, the film seems somewhat dull",UNK
1678,"and it gets monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing, too.",UNK
1679,"When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers",UNK
1680,unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that,UNK
1681,looks supremely cheesy. And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber.,UNK
1682,"And while most of the cast is at least decent, a few of the performances (particularly",UNK
1683,"the ""actress"" who plays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and the kid) are so bad they're constantly distracting.",UNK
1684,"This was just horrible the plot was just OK, but the rest of the was was",UNK
1685,bad . I mean come on puppet and then they even tried to make the movie,UNK
1686,digital and that made it even worse! Normally I would like low-budget movie but this was,UNK
1687,just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the set that it,UNK
1688,came on. I have about ten low-budget movie set with like 6-8 movies on them and,UNK
1689,I would have to say this is the worse movie out of all of them. Also,UNK
1690,the wording is off and they use a fake plastic machetes that doesn't even look like,UNK
1691,"a real one, they could of used one that looked even a little close to a",UNK
1692,real one so save your time and money and don't watch this horrorible movie.,UNK

1731,Zmed have him labeled as a nerd. And that's especially bad when Zmed's girl friend decides,UNK
1732,she likes Caulfield. But being a nerd just isn't going to cut it. That's when Caulfield,UNK
1733,decides to put on a modern day Zorro act. He gets a junked bicycle and puts,UNK
1734,it back together and teaches himself to ride. He gets himself a leather biker outfit with,UNK

1757,best - Succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film. I've got to admit that I,UNK
1758,"saw the American cut version, which runs at about 76 minutes; but unless it was just",UNK
1759,"the logic that was cut, I'm sure the longer European version is just as boring. The",UNK

1828,it all felt too predictable on its trudge to the requisite happy ending. There were funny,UNK
1829,"bits along the way to be sure, but few were original. At least it didn't go",UNK

1837,"the worst I've ever seen, and couldn't have been worse even if they were trying to",UNK
1838,make a complete mockery of this movie. The movie must have had a record breaking low,UNK
1839,budget which I'm sure was wasted almost solely on the movie's cover. This movie has now,UNK

1849,This just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling. No,UNK
1850,other movie has made me cringe in pain. Now I will point out exactly why this,UNK
1851,"movie is so incredibly atrocious. First off, the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip",UNK
1852,in a remote control car (?!) that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it. Dumb,UNK
1853,"stuff. The action that ensues is similar to that of the other two Home Alones, with",UNK
1854,"boobytraps and all, but watching these boobytraps being executed is, rather than being funny, incredibly unpleasant",UNK
1855,"to watch. I didn't laugh (or even so much as smile) once, rather, I cringed constantly",UNK
1856,"and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid. The bird, rather than providing comic relief,",UNK
1857,"was unfunny and annoying. The acting, as done by a bunch of no names, ranges from",UNK
1858,poor to atrocious. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely unlikeable,UNK
1859,"and unfunny as the kid, while the terrorists act (and judging by their movie credits, look)",UNK
1860,"as they've been hastily picked off the street...and well, that's it. I can see some people",UNK
1861,"saying: ""Man, it's for the kids. Don't dis it, man."" Well MAN, kids may like this,",UNK
1862,but they can get a hell of a lot better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story,UNK
1863,"before even considering getting this out. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which suck - see",UNK
1864,"those reviews for more) are better than this! So in short, this is an irredeemably atrocious",UNK
1865,"movie. This was clearly recycled for the money, as it almost completely rips off the first",UNK
1866,"two; the only thing is, it completely insults the first two as well. No human, kid",UNK

1868,stars,UNK
1869,It's hard to believe that this is a sequel to Henry Fool. Hard to believe that,UNK
1870,"the same director and actors were involved in both movies. While Henry Fool is refreshing, witty,",UNK
1871,"comical, Fay Grim is slow, boring, and doesn't go anywhere. Where has the wit gone? I",UNK
1872,am baffled. It is 10 years since I saw Henry Fool and many of its dialogs,UNK
1873,and scenes are still vivid in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to watch. This is,UNK
1874,"no fault of the actors, who are good (Parker Posey) or great (Jeff Goldblum) -- the",UNK
1875,"blame lies entirely with the plot, the dialog, and even some of the filming (low budget",UNK

1877,"so bored, so disappointed... if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy Henry Fool so",UNK
1878,much... the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other... there is no continuity,UNK
1879,in the characters' personalities... it's all a fraud to entice fans of Henry Fool to watch,UNK
1880,the sequel. I'm switching this off now -- Henry in some sort of jail with a,UNK
1881,Taliban?!?!,UNK
1882,"Absolutely one of the worst movies of the year. The plot is ridiculous, the characters poorly",UNK
1883,"developed, and the premise irritatingly stupid. It all begins when Michael Keaton, fresh off of doing",UNK
1884,"nothing noteworthy since Batman, loses his beautiful author wife, Anna, to a car accident, possibly caused",UNK
1885,by her driving one of those convertible VW bugs even though she's supposed to be rich.,UNK
1886,"In his grief, Batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a hobby: recording nothing",UNK
1887,and then watching it. He learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered,UNK

1889,"dead people, thanks to EVP, or Electronic Voice Phenomenon, which is evidently this deal wherein dead",UNK
1890,"people can send messages to living people through tape recorders, video cameras, dead cell phones (""Anna",UNK

1897,"using electronics, but I'll be d*mned if we can be on time! Am I right guys?",UNK
1898,"(They nod in bemused agreement).""). He tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that",UNK
1899,"this character from the first ten minutes of the movie (look hard, or you'll miss him!)",UNK
1900,"is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons, who in Raiders of the",UNK
1901,"Lost Ark style swoop down and kill him, looking like the cartoons that they are. Just",UNK
1902,"then some detectives show up and save the lady. After Batman's funeral, he decides to send",UNK
1903,"a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot, evidently feeling",UNK
1904,that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of EVP is to expose,UNK
1905,"him to it. The little kid just smiles. Nothing phases that dude, not even when his",UNK
1906,"dad, Batman of course, starts talking to TV's. The high-point of the movie was when someone's",UNK
1907,"phone rang and some guy yelled out, ""It's Anna!""",UNK
1908,"You'll notice that the chemist, who appears in two scenes and gets to speak, is played",UNK
1909,"by Stephen King. ""Don't give up your day job"" is the standard thing to say, but",UNK
1910,that's not fair. King acquits himself reasonably well: he's no worse than any other member of,UNK
1911,"the cast, and better than most. The story, on the other hand, is pure rubbish. Please,",UNK
1912,give up your day job. Never have I seen so many dreadful performances - of which,UNK
1913,the lead actor's (the LEAD ACTOR'S!) is probably the worst - gathered together in the one,UNK
1914,"film. Everyone acts hammily, but not in any entertaining way; they all somehow manage to go",UNK
1915,"over-the-top without expending, or manifesting, energy. I blame screenwriter/director Tom Holland. It can't be that ALL",UNK
1916,"the actors are REALLY this bad. What are the odds against that? Admittedly, I've never heard",UNK
1917,"of any of them before, but still, I don't think I could walk into a talent",UNK
1918,"agency and walk out with this many bad performers if I tried: ONE actor, despite my",UNK
1919,"best efforts, would turn out to have talent. So what's more likely - that Tom Holland",UNK
1920,"rolled a dozen consecutive snake-eyes, or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it",UNK
1921,poorly? That would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in,UNK
1922,"the script. The more direction an actor got, the worse he performed. (""You want me to",UNK
1923,"bend over like a hunchback, talk from the back of my throat, show all my teeth,",UNK
1924,"and look bored, all at the same time? Okay..."") This theory is confirmed by the fact",UNK
1925,that Holland undeniably managed to co-write a lousy script. Several writers here have commented on the,UNK
1926,"fact that Billy Halleck is not a likeable character, but that's a misleading way of putting",UNK
1927,it. He's not a knowable character. All we find out about him before the supernatural stuff,UNK
1928,"starts happening is that he's fat, and that all he can think about is food. (""All",UNK
1929,"I can think about is food,"" he tells us, helpfully.) And in the end... (Sigh) I",UNK
1930,suppose I ought insert a spoiler warning here... In the end he becomes evil. Why? I,UNK
1931,"can only shrug. Perhaps he's under some kind of enchantment. Yeah, that's probably it. By ""evil""",UNK
1932,"perhaps I mean ""inexplicable"" - it's not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of",UNK
1933,"ordinary means-end psychology. Anyway, his actions at the end make no sense, nobody's actions make much",UNK
1934,"sense, and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation",UNK
1935,"for the benefit of the audience. By the way, here's my nominee for hammiest line/delivery: ""I",UNK

1965,This one is really no exception. It begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and,UNK

1977,else I doubt I would have come back! This one makes Hammer House of Horror look,UNK
1978,like a big screen Hollywood epic. The only value to this movie was the never ending,UNK
1979,supply of beautiful women. Not a bad one among them! If you want to letch with,UNK
1980,your friends after a night on the beer then this one's for you ... else avoid,UNK
1981,it like the plague!,UNK
1982,The film is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak,UNK
1983,"and outdated, especially for this country. I don't think most people know what a ""walker"" is",UNK
1984,or will really care. I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70's.,UNK
1985,"The subject was just not believable for the year 2007, even being set in DC. I",UNK
1986,think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low,UNK
1987,and quick at the end. Most didn't stay for the Q&A either. I don't think Schrader,UNK
1988,really thought the film out ahead of time. Many of the scenes seemed to be cut,UNK
1989,short as if they were never finished or he just didn't know how to finish them.,UNK
1990,He jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out,UNK
1991,or guess what was going on. I really didn't get Woody's (Carter) private life or boyfriend,UNK
1992,"either. What were all the ""artistic"" male bondage and torture pictures (from Iraq prisons) about? What",UNK
1993,was he thinking? I think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this,UNK
1994,dark private subculture life for Woody's character (Car). It didn't work. It didn't even seem to,UNK
1995,make sense really. The only good thing about this film was Woody Harrelson. He played his,UNK
1996,"character (Car) flawlessly. You really did get a great sense of what a ""walker"" may have",UNK
1997,been like (say twenty years ago). He was great and most likely will never get recognized,UNK
1998,"for it. As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin... Boring. Don't see it! It is painful! Unless",UNK
1999,you are a true Harrelson fan.,UNK
2000,Nightmare Weekend is proof positive that some people are so desperate to be 'in the movies',UNK
2001,they are prepared to do almost anything. I'm not referring to the countless women who seem,UNK
2002,"quite happy to appear completely starkers in this dreadful piece of trash (after all, the naked",UNK
2003,female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No...I'm talking about those,UNK
2004,who are more than willing to co-star with a badly made hand-puppet called George. Now that,UNK
2005,"is embarrassing!!! A bio-electronic being created by brilliant scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks",UNK
2006,like a demented felt clown with green wool for hair) is the artificially intelligent interface for,UNK
2007,an advanced computer system that operates a revolutionary device (a silver sphere about the size of,UNK
2008,"a golf ball) that, when ingested, can reverse character disorders. Edward's personality altering experiments have been",UNK
2009,"successful on lab animals, but the cautious scientist is reluctant to carry out tests on human",UNK
2010,"subjects, fearing that there may still be side effects. His evil assistant Julie (Debbie Laster), however,",UNK
2011,"has no such qualms, and proceeds to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably,",UNK
2012,"they all turn into hideous killer mutants. With bargain basement special effects, a cast totally devoid",UNK
2013,"of talent, and a plot that is almost impossible to follow (I took notes as I",UNK
2014,"watched the film, and even then I am not entirely convinced that my synopsis is accurate),",UNK
2015,Nightmare Weekend is a complete and utter disaster that not even several soft-core sex scenes and,UNK
2016,a touch of gore can rescue. This film also features one of the most irritating characters,UNK
2017,"I have ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), a Walkman wearing idiot who",UNK
2018,bops away to crap 80s music in a manner that makes me look like Justin Timberlake,UNK
2019,in comparison.,UNK
2020,Here's why the Jane Show won't work. Once again Canadian bonehead producers and writers can't create,UNK
2021,a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it. I guess these people don't,UNK
2022,"watch a lot of T.V. from the U.S. which has the sitcom model down pat. No,",UNK
2023,"here we have to do something different, we have to make the A story absolutely absurd",UNK
2024,and then have a meaningful B story to try to make up for it. The characters,UNK
2025,are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top: Forklift races??? give me,UNK
2026,"freaking break. Here's a little advice for the writers of the show, Don't write funny situations,",UNK
2027,"find the funny in situations. And remember, you have to be born with a sense of",UNK
2028,"humor to write truly funny stuff, not just be an improv monkey.",UNK
2029,"...okay, maybe not all of it. Lured by the false promise of bikini-clad women on the",UNK
2030,"movie's cover...but the HORROR...THE HORROR... ...whatever you do, do NOT watch this movie. Gouge out your",UNK
2031,"eyes, repeatedly bash your skull in...do what it takes. Never again--never forget!",UNK
2032,"A truly unpleasant film. While Rick Baker's special effects are quite impressive (if stomach-turning), it has",UNK
2033,"no other redeeming features. Like many 70s movies, it leaves you feeling as if you need",UNK
2034,"to take a long shower, and scrub the slime off of yourself. The characters are uniformly",UNK
2035,"unpleasant, and plot makes no sense.",UNK
2036,"I was a huge fan of the original cartoon series, and was looking forward to finally",UNK
2037,seeing Gadget on the big screen -- but I never in my wildest dreams expected something,UNK
2038,"so extremely extremely terrible. The pace was WAY too fast, there was no plot, and 'wowser!'",UNK
2039,- what the hell is that?? It was 'WOWSERS!!'.,UNK
2040,"The premise is amazing and the some of the acting, notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp,",UNK
2041,is charming... but this film is near unwatchable. The music sounds as if it comes from,UNK
2042,some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written,UNK
2043,with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap. Most of the singing is off-key. I think,UNK
2044,they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it... The,UNK
2045,dialogue is really stupid and trite. The movie works best when it is actually talking about,UNK
2046,the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub-plots. I found myself,UNK
2047,checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering 'when is it ever,UNK
2048,going to end.',UNK
2049,"Wow. I don't even really remember that much about this movie, except that it stunk. The",UNK
2050,"plot's basically; a girl's parents neglect her, so this sicko PokeMon pretends to be her dad.",UNK
2051,"Am I the only one disturbed by that? Then, this weirdo PokeMon kidnaps Ash's mom to",UNK
2052,pretend to be the girl's. I don't care if he was trying to make the girl,UNK
2053,"happy, that's just gross. There was no real plot. The girl was just a whiny brat",UNK
2054,"who wanted things her own way. She played with Unowns, was the ""daughter"" of Entei and",UNK
2055,"apparently could grow and shrink in age on a whim with the help of her ""dad"".",UNK
2056,"That's pretty much all I can remember, but I think you can take it as a",UNK
2057,"hint, and not see it. (Or if you do see it, don't expect much.) 1 out",UNK
2058,"of 10. Seriously. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent ""PokeMon; the First Movie"".",UNK
2059,The Pallbearer is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just,UNK
2060,doesn't work partly with the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow walks through the entire,UNK
2061,film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what David Schwimmer,UNK
2062,even sees in her. However The Pallbearer at times is funny particularly the church scene and,UNK
2063,the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but that's basically it. Watch The Pallbearer,UNK
2064,for those scenes only and fast forward the rest. Trust me you aren't missing much.,UNK
2065,"Some funny bits, but come Bill! A film? Quoting Zeitgeist? Keep the TV Show and the",UNK
2066,"interviews, but a film? I'm probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film... I don't know.",UNK
2067,"I laughed, disagreed, agreed... this film is very confusing and inconsistent. Bill's a funny guy... but",UNK
2068,"also very cocky... Bill's rhetoric is similar to Bill Hicks, a brilliant comedian. But like many",UNK
2069,"comedians, the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying. I think that the major problem",UNK
2070,"in this film is his lack of sensibility. This might be just a personal taste, but",UNK
2071,comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth. Bill is obviously emotionally reactive to,UNK
2072,"religious fundamentalism. I agree with Bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible, but the response to",UNK
2073,it cannot be sensible. It will create unnecessary turmoil. We can do better than just react,UNK
2074,"to fundamentalism. His conclusion is that ""we don't know"" and he fervently tries to convince the",UNK
2075,"spectator that nobody knows anything, to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with",UNK
2076,his lack of serious research in comparative religion. His humility that he only knows that he,UNK
2077,"doesn't, is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non-sense. I",UNK
2078,"had great trouble seeing bits of Zeitgeist, the movie in Bill's film. All the astrotheology-influenced non-sense",UNK
2079,that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing. Zeitgeist has provoked a lot of,UNK
2080,controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable Religion Studies scholarship.,UNK
2081,It is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources.,UNK
2082,"Astro-mystic sources that reduce everything to ""the stars say it all"" seem to be from the",UNK
2083,"Middle Ages. This film is a confusing statement from a confused ""agnostic"". Agnosticism is far more",UNK
2084,"complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as ""we don't know"". This film is",UNK
2085,an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in,UNK
2086,human history. Watch the film (it has hilarious interviews and bits) but PLEASE do not behave,UNK
2087,like Bill. You cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic,UNK
2088,"comments in every other line. His arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting, provoking emotional reactions rather",UNK
2089,than rational and logical argumentation.. There needs to be a more mature way of dealing with,UNK
2090,these issues.,UNK
2091,"That's not just my considered verdict on this film, but also on the bulk of what",UNK
2092,"has been written about it. Now don't get me wrong here either, I'm not a total",UNK
2093,"philistine, I didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like 'police academy 9' or whatever,",UNK
2094,"I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff, I swear. 'Magnolia'",UNK
2095,"is poor, and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed. Long",UNK
2096,"winded, self indulgent, rambling nonsense from start to finish, there is just so little that could",UNK
2097,"credibly be what people so love about the movie. There's some high calibre actors fair enough,",UNK
2098,"and none turns in an average or worse performance. Furthermore, my wife (a self confessed Tom",UNK
2099,Cruise hater) tells me it's his career best performance by far. But the plot is so,UNK
2100,"completely unengaging, meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail's pace",UNK
2101,that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you,UNK
2102,find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something. It doesn't help that,UNK
2103,none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with (well I didn't think,UNK
2104,"so, but I don't like most people admittedly). They all play out their rather unentertaining life",UNK
2105,"stories at great length, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-so intricate detail and playing",UNK
2106,out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en,UNK
2107,"route. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack's dire as well, with that marrow-suckingly irritating quality that I",UNK
2108,"had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisette. All in all, it was about",UNK
2109,as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of 'Friends' whilst,UNK
2110,being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat. The bit with the frogs,UNK
2111,is good though.,UNK
2112,This movie commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The movie supposedly,UNK
2113,"caused quite a stir among the critics in Cannes, but for me the final scene was",UNK
2114,just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed. Hardly a voice in,UNK
2115,"the discussion on the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue,",UNK
2116,"for that matter). The main character's metamorphosis from good, but troubled boy to the vicious rapist",UNK
2117,"is virtually nonexistent, whereas the rape scene (being an over-dragged, exaggerated version of the rape scene",UNK
2118,"from ""A clockwork orange"") is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There",UNK
2119,are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his/her goal. At least,UNK
