<pending_infer>. when i got to the stop sign , the check engine light started flashing . i panicked and carefully drove the van to the nearest mechanic shop . they checked it out but could not repair the van . the van had to be sold for parts and i had to get a new vehicle .
the man won a contest . he went to the station to collect . <pending_infer>. he did n't really like the band . he tried to sell them back to the radio employees .
