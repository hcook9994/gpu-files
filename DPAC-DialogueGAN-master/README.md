This repo implements DP-GAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01345) and SeqGAN for Neural Dialogue generation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06547). Additionally, we propose a new Actor Critic framework for DP-GAN which we call DPAC-GAN. This project is done for the course Information Retrieval 2 as part of the Masters in Artificial Intelligence. 

We based code for the generator on seq2seq models from IBM (https://github.com/IBM/pytorch-seq2seq) and use NLG-Eval from (https://github.com/Maluuba/nlg-eval).
