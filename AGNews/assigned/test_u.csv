3,"in theatres, it was better than some garbage I've seen on the big screen. I would",UNK
4,say it's worth seeing.,UNK
5,"A well-made and imaginative production, refreshingly free from cliché, this somewhat picaresque affair recounts a tale",UNK
6,of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal,UNK
7,conditions: the man an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a,UNK
8,"hostage. Expertly directed by Alan Gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement, the film",UNK
9,"provides freshness in nearly every scene, as felon Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), believing that his rejection",UNK
10,"for parole was particularly undeserved, contrives a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan, following which his",UNK
11,spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood.,UNK
12,"Often bursting into song or dancing a few steps, the capricious Steckert gradually gains the trust",UNK
13,"and affection of his captive and, as police close in for an inevitable showdown, the tethered",UNK
14,"pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their responses to forms of rejection,",UNK
15,as discerned by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) assigned to aid a zealous police lieutenant (James Coburn),UNK
16,"who is in charge of the manhunt for Steckert and his ""prisoner"". This is an engrossing",UNK

21,"First off, I'd like to make a correction on another review of this film which said",UNK
22,that the last musical to win the Best Picture Academy Award was 'Gigi' in 1958. That,UNK
23,"is misinformation as 'West Side Story' won in 1962, 'My Fair Lady' won in 1965 and",UNK
24,"'Sound of Music' won the year after that. That said, this film is absolutely fantastic! The",UNK
25,"story from the novel has been somewhat altered, but that's more because of the limitations that",UNK
26,"they had on a stage that they just didn't change back for a filmed version. However,",UNK
27,"I don't mind. In fact, I rather think the whole production flows better than the novel",UNK
28,does. I like Nancy bringing Oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead,UNK
29,of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this film are the ones that make,UNK
30,me laugh. I love the moment Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble start coming out at the,UNK
31,beginning from the governors office. The underscore for that moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors,UNK
32,"for this film were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any film version of",UNK
33,"the story, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagin (this character is worked out much better",UNK
34,"than he is in the book), and Shani Wallis, who is the strongest, most distressed version",UNK
35,of Nancy. The only reason I'm giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is,UNK
36,because of the two big production numbers which are 'Concider Yourself' and 'Who Will Buy.' I,UNK
37,always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores,UNK
38,"and jobs. It looks awful and cheesy, especially when they're dancing at the London Meat Co.",UNK
39,"They should've just done regular choreography for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure",UNK
40,"that will stay with us, hopefully, forever.",UNK
41,I was never a big fan of television until I watched 24 for the first time.,UNK
42,I got into the series very late. Season 5 ended before I even saw my very,UNK
43,first episode. It was an episode of Series 3 that was on my parents DVR (digital,UNK
44,video recorder) box while I was house sitting for the weekend. It took that one episode,UNK
45,for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of Jack Bauer. And boy,UNK
46,was I hooked!! I watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye. The next day,UNK
47,I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars,UNK
48,and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money I've ever spent. I watched,UNK
49,the first three seasons in three weeks. That's 72 forty minute episodes!!! I will say that,UNK
50,finding out what happens next is easier on DVD than waiting an entire week. I can,UNK
51,only imagine the anticipation of watching Season 6 week to week!! I find it mildly torturous,UNK
52,and cruel but I'm going to give it a try and watch it just like the,UNK
53,rest of America!! The DVR is set and you can bet I'll be chomping at the,UNK
54,bit!!,UNK
55,A very strange and compelling movie. It's about a very awkward and tightly wound man who,UNK
56,attempts to navigate his life as a door-to-door fundraiser/salesman. The director was able to capture a,UNK
57,very unnerving tone that really served the story well. Original and unsettling while also finding a,UNK
58,great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life. There is a sequence at a,UNK
59,testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something,UNK
60,I do as frequently as I should. One of the more memorable films I've seen in,UNK
61,a long while. Hasn't left my mind and I look forward to future efforts by Bronstein.,UNK
62,"Fantastic performances all around. The simple line ""I really appreciate it."" is now iconic to me.",UNK
63,This is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of Trek. There is just so,UNK
64,much going on in this one film that its crazy cool. First the guys beam down,UNK
65,to an alien planet thats about to explode. They meet a freaky librarian type dude (very,UNK
66,well played). Then Kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like,UNK
67,16th century earth. McCoy and Spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on,UNK
68,"the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past. Kirk manages to get",UNK
69,himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while Spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy,UNK
70,"cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen, awful world by some bad guy. Spock decides",UNK
71,hes happy where hes at and gives McCoy a royal assestment whuppin' when the doc suggests,UNK
72,"they need to look for a way out. Anyhow,they all finally escape, leaving the poor cavegirl",UNK
73,behind. It takes a ton of convincing before Spock finally gives in and leaves. You can,UNK
74,literally taste the sadness at the end. Leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland,UNK
75,just seems cruel and is really touching. Spock must have been out of his vulkin' mind,UNK
76,"to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human. Albeit, in a not so",UNK
77,"nice neighborhood! Anyway, you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode....A love",UNK
78,"story, the Salem witch trials, Spock as a human, the desperation of being left in total",UNK
79,"isolation...abandoned, and three entirely different settings on the alien planet. Its amazing they managed to jam",UNK
80,"all this into one fifty minute film. This one is a classic, don't miss it....I want",UNK
81,it on DVD fer shure vulcans!!!!!!,UNK
82,"enjoyed the movie and efficient Confucian crime drama, the old order survives the threat posed by",UNK
83,"a brash young greedy man, no doubt representing modern society. I thought the final scene was",UNK
84,strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big D was being punished,UNK
85,for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long. I loved the scene,UNK
86,"and for once in a Chinese movie, the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest.",UNK
87,On thing that always amuses me about HK films is that the main influence the British,UNK
88,seem to have had is to introduce 'yes sir' and 'sorry' into the local language and,UNK
89,"its amusing that long after we have gone, they are still there.",UNK
90,This movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents,UNK
91,can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids. The movie seems and is mostly geared,UNK
92,towards children yet it does not stop on this level. I watched this movie first as,UNK
93,"a young child and found it to be funny, entertaining,and heartwarming and did not see it",UNK
94,again for several years. I watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to,UNK
95,be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining. This movie is highly underrated and,UNK
96,contains many messages of real life. This movie is an inspirational quest story that is made,UNK
97,for kids yet epic in its own right. I recommend this movie to anyone of any,UNK
98,age.,UNK
99,"Steve Carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on",UNK
100,"'The Daily Show', and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell has found a clever",UNK
101,"and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle aged",UNK
102,"man living a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice",UNK
103,"guy sort of way. One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy",UNK
104,"accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and",UNK
105,Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. But it's clear that all three have,UNK
106,"a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is, and they resolve to help",UNK
107,him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. And so begins Andy's quest into adulthood.,UNK
108,"Andy is the quintessential innocent, and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to",UNK
109,the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. Some of the humor is crude gross,UNK
110,"out stuff, but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. In addition, I found",UNK
111,some parts of the film actually pretty touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships,UNK
112,and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray the,UNK
113,"movie as a love story or a drama; it's a rolling in your seats comedy. Still,",UNK
114,every good comedy I have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the,UNK
115,characters. A good comparison would be 'The Wedding Crashers' from earlier this summer. Virgin has a,UNK
116,"similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. I particularly",UNK
117,"loved the ending of the film, which I thought was a perfect way to end the",UNK
118,"flick. Without giving anything away, it reminded me of 'Something About Mary'. Very light and fun;",UNK
119,"it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish",UNK
120,a comedy. I would highly recommend.,UNK
121,"If, like me, you like your films to be unique, and unlike the majority of other",UNK
122,"movies, then I wholly recommend that you check out The Beast. The film is a grotesque,",UNK
123,"erotic, fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological 'Beast' that is rumoured to wander the grounds",UNK
124,of a French mansion and lusts after women. The film is very daring with it's subject,UNK
125,"material, and that is something to give it credit for. The theme of bestiality is a",UNK
126,"definite taboo, and for good reason, I might add; but the film conveys it; straight and",UNK
127,"to the point. Like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre, The Beast",UNK
128,"could have gone around it, and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps,",UNK
129,"but Borowczyk didn't do that, and he is brave in that respect, especially as making a",UNK
130,"film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms, but the fact that",UNK
131,"he went ahead with it, in my view, means a big thumbs up for the guy.",UNK
132,The film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female.,UNK
133,"This opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience, in some ways,",UNK
134,"for the incredible, tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see. The scenes",UNK
135,"which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking, and are bound to",UNK
136,"offend many people (hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years), but these scenes",UNK
137,are not merely an excuse for Borowczyk to shock the viewer; this film has a defining,UNK
138,point. As said during the film; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence. Both,UNK
139,"man and beast have instincts, only man knows how to control them. The Beast explores this",UNK
140,difference between man and beast through sexuality; the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises,UNK
141,"the control of human desire, and it is only when the central female character lets go",UNK
142,of her control that she can see the beast. The film has strong themes of the,UNK
143,"age-old story of 'beauty and beast' weaved into it, and overall this is a shockingly morbid",UNK
144,"tale of lust, but not without a moral. Many criticise the scenes around the film's shocking",UNK
145,"sex sequences for being boring, but these scenes are important to the film's story. Without these",UNK
146,"scenes, we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast, and, most",UNK
147,importantly; the story of 'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying,UNK
148,"conclusion dealt to the audience, and as that is one of the key elements of the",UNK
149,"film; it would be a real shame. Besides that, Borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these",UNK
150,"scenes, not with shocks, but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family, along",UNK
151,"with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen, and therefore the stark",UNK
152,"contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either. Overall,",UNK
153,The Beast is a shocking film. It's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way,UNK
154,"it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone. However, if you can",UNK
155,"get over the film's shock, and embrace The Beast; what awaits is a skilful and beautiful",UNK
156,piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this,UNK
157,film a chance.,UNK
158,i would like to comment the series as a great effort. The story line although requiring,UNK
159,"a few improvements was pretty well, especially in season 1. Season 2 however became more of",UNK
160,"a freak show, and lost DA's original charm. Season one story line was more interesting, a",UNK
161,light side to the life at Jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing,UNK
162,"down the X-series. i was looking forward to new seasons, in fact i still am. I",UNK
163,hope the FOX guys and DA production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait,UNK
164,"for DA to make a comeback. Even after 2 yrs of it being cancelled, DA can",UNK
165,"make it big if worked on properly, and i think a name like James Cameron should",UNK
166,take on this challenge.,UNK
167,One night I stumbled upon this on the satellite station Bravo.Initially out of curiosity i decided,UNK
168,to watch it.To be perfectly honest i wasn't disappointed.The main character is beautiful and her body,UNK
169,is shown off well.You would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently,UNK
170,not after watching the whole film!My only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast,UNK
171,particularly the actor who plays Melnik.Christ its bad!The prison guard Hank is woeful too.All he ever,UNK
172,does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co-guard Wanda though fortunately for,UNK
173,us the viewer and for Hank he gets down and dirty with Wanda near the end.,UNK
174,The music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions. This movie,UNK
175,"is well watching alone for the beautiful,talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas",UNK
176,"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you",UNK
177,"expect. It's not a bad movie; it's actually pretty good. If you don't like the show,",UNK
178,"don't see the movie. It starts off a little slow maybe, but then picks up and",UNK
179,"turns out to be pretty funny. There are even a few ""heart-wrenching"" scenes toward the end.",UNK
180,After all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you. Also Jerry throws,UNK
181,in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show's existience. He's got a,UNK
182,"pretty good point. We care so much about the private details of celebrities lives, so why",UNK
183,"is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national TV, too. If they",UNK
184,"were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all, we'd eat it up. Do we not like his",UNK
185,guest doing this just because they're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really,UNK
186,"is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a ""Leave",UNK
187,"it to Beaver"" world?",UNK
188,"I happened upon this film by accident, and really enjoyed. Timothy Busfield's character is without redeeming",UNK
189,"qualities, and at one point, Busfield and star Meloni ogle women as they pass by...Meloni's take",UNK
190,on the parade is different from Busfield's. Janel Maloney is terrific...She looks very much like Tea,UNK
191,"Leone, but the major difference here is that Janel can actually ACT. Some very nice things",UNK
192,in this film and well worth your attention when it's on cable.,UNK
193,"Sure it was well shot and made, very well shot and made! But the story was",UNK
194,just so weak. And the portrayal of Lincoln was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda wasn't,UNK
195,good but the character he played was nothing but a loon. Do you mean to tell,UNK
196,me that Lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or,UNK
197,the court. I mean who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean,UNK
198,"come on, ""I'll just call you Jackass then""???? I understand that Ford was going for great",UNK
199,"funny hero guy but I didn't really like this guy at all. He cheats in sports,",UNK
200,talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in,UNK
201,a courtroom. How am I supposed to take this seriously. The twist was even weaker. I,UNK
202,mean come on! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed like it was thought up,UNK
203,"by some 5 year old in his or her dreams. Saying that I liked it enough,",UNK
204,it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so I can't say it's,UNK
205,"a bad film. In fact I must say that I must say it's good enough, nothing",UNK
206,that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad BUT this vivid and silly story,UNK
207,was just so ridiculous that I can't understand how anyone could consider it great. I have,UNK
208,no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true I,UNK
209,would really have to shake my head.,UNK
210,"""Heartland"" is a wonderful depiction of what it was really like to live on the frontier.",UNK
211,The hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the hardships of the climate,UNK
212,and the lack of medical care are blended with the camaraderie and the interdependence of the,UNK
213,settlers. The drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the diaries of real,UNK
214,people whose descendants still live there. It was also nice to see the west inhabited by,UNK
215,real people. No one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session,UNK
216,with the makeup or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is just wonderful. She is an example of,UNK
217,"the strong, persevering people who came to Wyoming in the early 20th century and let no",UNK
218,hardship stand in their way of a new life in a new land.,UNK
219,"I saw the film twice in the space of one week, both times the at a",UNK
220,"cinema in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was packed both times and people had to be",UNK
221,turned away. From the start of the film with Henry Winkler getting 'injured' on the football,UNK
222,"field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter, laughter that lasted until the credits. For",UNK
223,"those who love American wrestling this film is a must, but be ready to see Henry",UNK
224,Winkler as you have never seen him before. Also look out for a very well known,UNK
225,actor whose trademark wrestling move is a head-but! If you get a chance watch this movie,UNK
226,and it is family comedy entertainment at its best!,UNK
227,"This is not ""so bad that it is good,"" it is purely good! For those who",UNK
228,"don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a",UNK
229,"certain comment...) Anyways, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you,",UNK
230,and a parody of me. It is the single most genius text in cinematic history. I,UNK
231,have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa.,UNK
232,It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard. I,UNK
233,"write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me, the likes",UNK
234,of which we have never seen. It can only be taken in portions... its sort of,UNK
235,exploitive... by now I'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum. My comment ended,UNK
236,a while ago. Hopefully it works when I submit it now.,UNK
237,"Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt,",UNK
238,"retribution and despair from ""Scarface"". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The",UNK
239,"darker side of the fabled ""American Dream"". Anybody complaining about the ""cheesiness"" of this film is",UNK
240,"missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of",UNK
241,"this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on",UNK
242,"any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the",UNK
243,gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana. This isn't Brian DePalma's,UNK
244,"strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks",UNK
245,"to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone",UNK
246,"(probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The",UNK
247,"themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution",UNK
248,"of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent,",UNK
249,"see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their",UNK
250,way into popular culture in one form or another. The cast help make it what it,UNK
251,"is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances",UNK
252,"(something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone",UNK
253,"and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally",UNK
254,"over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly",UNK
255,one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first,UNK
256,"viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little",UNK
257,"wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly",UNK
258,"Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa. Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. ""Scarface""",UNK
259,is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential,UNK
260,"and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",UNK
261,This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend this,UNK
262,movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith.,UNK
263,Although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life,UNK
264,changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone. I saw this movie with my,UNK
265,family and I can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart. This,UNK
266,movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how,UNK
267,"much tribulation he was faced with. After I saw this movie,there was not a single dry",UNK
268,eye in the entire room. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I have not,UNK
269,been the same since I have seen it. I highly recommend this movie for everyone.,UNK
270,"Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress, dealing",UNK
271,"with success, aging, loneliness...and alcoholism. She tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts, embodied by the",UNK
272,"death spectre of a young girl. Acceptance of oneself, of human condition, though its overall difficulties,",UNK
273,is the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film,UNK
274,itself are puzzling: it's like if the stage became a way out for the Heroin. If,UNK
275,"all american movies could only be that top-quality, dealing with human relations on an adult level,",UNK
276,not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings... One of the best dramas ever. 10/10.,UNK
277,"Sure, it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny, but at least the filmmakers didn't",UNK
278,"try. While most TV movies border on the brink of mediocrity, this film actually has some",UNK
279,"redeeming qualities to it. The cinematography was pretty good for a TV film, and Viggo Mortensen",UNK
280,displays shades of Aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules.,UNK
281,"Most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy, but the scene with the mountain lion",UNK
282,was intense. I was kind of annoyed by Jason Priestly's role in the film as a,UNK
283,"rebellious shock-jock, but then again, it's a TV MOVIE! Despite all of the good things, the",UNK
284,"soundtrack was atrocious. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona prominently featured in the film.",UNK
285,"For a movie with a plot like this I would normally smell ""tearjerker"" in the first",UNK
286,"ten minutes and turn it off, but this was very well made, with emotional subtleties, great",UNK
287,"acting, and some genuinely funny moments. It was also interesting to see a different culture -",UNK
288,a vanishing one at that. My wife and I both dug it!,UNK
289,A meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize,UNK
290,the area around Crater Lake . As the monster eats the locals they try and find,UNK
291,away of killing the monster. Recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films,UNK
292,like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have,UNK
293,films like Crater Lake Monster available for screening. It's the sort of film that those films,UNK
294,spoof and send up only this is the real deal. Its everything those films try to,UNK
295,be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of,UNK
296,it. This is a real drive-in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming,UNK
297,"just as Star Wars changed the way we look at special effects. The monster, a mix",UNK
298,"of stop motion and a life size head, is a charmingly quaint little beast. The filmmakers",UNK

300,"its all fake, but isn't movies about suspension of disbelief? Actually I think its about really",UNK
301,"cool monsters, which this has. I like this movie in a low budget drive in sort",UNK
302,of a way. If you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther.,UNK
303,This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films (Boggy,UNK
304,Creek etc.),UNK
305,"While it certainly wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, it was certainly worth the $8",UNK
306,(which can't be said for many movies these days.) This was a pleasant account of a,UNK
307,"true story, although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie,",UNK
308,"(ie, Billy Sunday's character was three or four people in the real story combined together.) Robert",UNK

310,I just recently watched this 1954 movie starring Vincent Price for the first time on Turner,UNK
311,"Classic Movies. Price portrays Don Gallico, a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss",UNK
312,"steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, portrayed in a brief role by",UNK
313,"the lovely Eva Gabor). Even though Price is a murderer, I actually found myself rooting for",UNK
314,"him, he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him",UNK
315,"who keep taking advantage of him. Although this movie doesn't have the ""horror"" factor of some",UNK
316,"of his more famous roles (such as my favorite, ""House of Wax"") it nonetheless has enough",UNK
317,going for it to keep the viewers interest. This is a must for Vincent Price fans.,UNK
318,Starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to those all star musical pictures that every studio,UNK
319,was putting out during the World War II years. When you've got such stars as Gary,UNK
320,"Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, and Randolph Scott, etc., in the film and with",UNK
321,"such people as the Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn supplying the music,",UNK
322,it's an easy to take film. And the plot isn't even in the way. What plot,UNK
323,"there is involves two Air Force enlisted men, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, trying to meet",UNK
324,"Warner Brothers starlet Janice Rule using as a gimmick the fact that both come from Youngstown,",UNK
325,Ohio and Hagerthy's father was Rule's dentist as well as half of the town's. The scheme,UNK
326,works too well as Louella Parsons is soon putting them as an item in her column.,UNK
327,"Yes, Louella's in the film as well. She must have liked Warner Brothers or Jack Warner",UNK
328,catered to her more than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to,UNK
329,publicize her Hollywood Hotel radio program back in the day. But the rest of the plot,UNK
330,also touched on the real life efforts of Ruth Roman also playing herself to get her,UNK
331,studio and others to do shows at the Air Force bases for the servicemen and women,UNK
332,going to Korea. Some of the names I've mentioned and others sing and perform in a,UNK
333,show at Travis Air Force Base where a lot of this film was shot. One specialty,UNK
334,"number was shot for the talents of Phil Harris who sing/narrates a ballad Look Out Stranger,",UNK
335,"I'm A Texas Ranger aided and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yup,",UNK
336,Cooper looked like he was having a great old time kidding his image. This is the,UNK
337,"oldest of clichés when you say they don't make them like this any more, but they",UNK
338,really don't because you don't have a studio system that has all this talent under contract.,UNK
339,That's one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn.,UNK
340,"Antonio Margheriti's ""Danza Macabra"" aka. ""Castle Of Blood"" of 1964 is a beautiful and incredibly haunting",UNK

370,"A famous orchestra conductor, Daniel Dareus, suffers what appears a heart attack as he finished conducting",UNK
371,"a concert. Suddenly, we watch him as he arrives in the small town that he has",UNK
372,"left years before. Since he left so young, and having his name changed contributes to give",UNK
373,him a new persona. He has bought the old school building where he plans to stay.,UNK
374,The building needs a lot of work. One would expect a man in his position to,UNK
375,have all the comforts of the world he left behind to be installed in his new,UNK

380,"Lena, who works in the local store where he goes to get his food supplies. Little",UNK
381,"by little, he comes around and decides to involve himself with the choir. Lena will ultimately",UNK
382,"fall in love with Daniel. At first, the relationship between Daniel and the choir members is",UNK
383,"not exactly what he expected. As they get to know him better, they come around to",UNK
384,accept him and make him one of them. His new position doesn't endear him to the,UNK
385,"woman who used to be in charge. The members of the choir are a motley crew,",UNK
386,but they realize the change Daniel has made in the way they interpret different songs. The,UNK
387,"new piece composed for Gabriella, a battered wife, makes a great impact in her life and",UNK

396,"who is late for his own concert, gets to hear them making extraordinary music even though",UNK
397,"he is not in among them. Kay Pollak, the director of this enormously appealing film, shows",UNK
398,he was the man to direct it. The story involves the viewer from the start. Great,UNK
399,part of the success of the movie goes to the ensemble cast that was put together.,UNK
400,"William Nykvist, who plays the leading role is the best excuse for watching the film. Frida",UNK
401,"Hallgren, Niklas Falk, Ylva Loof, do excellent work for Mr. Pollak. Stefan Nilsson is the composer",UNK
402,for most of the beautiful music one hears. Harald Gunnar Paalgard's cinematography makes the film look,UNK
403,better capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty.,UNK
404,"This movie is bufoonery! and I loved it! The ""dragon lord"" (Jacky Chan) and his buddy,",UNK

406,blend of a good vs. evil fight and (somehow) the wonders and fun that is growing,UNK
407,"up. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young ""dragon lord""",UNK
408,"(so named because he is the son of a wealthy family) and ""cowboy"", which include implementing",UNK
409,"clever, elaborate ways to escape studying (with the help of the entire household, including the tutor),",UNK
410,"competing in rather boyish (and idiotically interesting) ways to gain the affection of a local girl,",UNK
411,"competing in ""soccer"" (you will see what i mean) and the list goes on. Somehow they",UNK
412,find themselves in the midst of a fight to save the a shipment of valuable antiques,UNK
413,and the lives of several people. The movie has its serious moments. But they do not,UNK
414,"depress, but rather inspire. The playfulness of the boys are not lost in this exchange, but",UNK
415,is actually employed against evil. What I really loved about this movie is how it ends.,UNK
416,"Not the typical confrontation (which in itself was awesome), but well, you'll see. Let me just",UNK
417,"say it truly captures the spirit of the movie. silly, witty, meaningful, and nostalgic. great movie.",UNK

428,This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts. Few actors are able to play the stoic,UNK
429,"as Jet Li can. The action is rapid-fire, and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes. As a",UNK

431,way in a Jet Li film. I feel that it is an excellent introduction to Jet's,UNK

443,"Claire Denis has demonstrated repeatedly that film does not need to tell a story, that it",UNK
444,is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make,UNK
445,of them what they will. Ostensibly the idea within the framework of a most non-linear film,UNK
446,"is the older man living on the French-Swiss border, a man devoted to his dogs, who",UNK
447,"still has a lover, but whose cardiac status increasingly threatens his life. He has a son",UNK
448,"with a little family who infrequently meet with him, but when he discovers he is in",UNK
449,need of a heart transplant he opts for going to Tahiti via Japan to obtain a,UNK
450,heart transplant on the black market and to rekindle a long lost relationship with a son,UNK
451,he had form a Tahitian women years ago. What Denis does with this outline of a,UNK
452,"story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vastness of nature,",UNK
453,"man's interaction with people vs animals, etc. Much of the time the 'film' doesn't make sense,",UNK
454,but that is because we try too hard to connect all the dots laid out before,UNK
455,"us in beautiful pictures. Life is sort of like that: we look, see, observe, integrate, process,",UNK
456,and make of it what we will. In using this form of film making (much as,UNK
457,she did in the strangely beautiful 'Beau Travail') Claire Denis has developed a signature technique. Whether,UNK
458,or not the viewer finds the finished product rewarding has much to do with our individual,UNK
459,"methods of processing visual and conceptual information. This is an interesting and visually captivating film, but",UNK
460,many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little. Perhaps watching again will,UNK
461,change that. Grady Harp,UNK
462,"As if most people didn't already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry, this",UNK
463,little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm. A successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife,UNK
464,going down on the pool man (on their anniversary of all days!) and snaps big time,UNK
465,"into a furious breakdown. After shooting an attack dog's head off, he strolls into work and",UNK
466,ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do,UNK
467,"about his ""slut"" of a wife. There are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing, tongue-cutting, and",UNK
468,"beauty queen fondling, as well as a marvelously deranged performance by Corbin Bernsen. The scene in",UNK
469,which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely,UNK
470,hard to watch. A dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the,UNK
471,"deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail. ""The Dentist"" is incredibly entertaining, fast-paced,",UNK
472,and laughably gory at times. Check it out!,UNK
473,I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site. I would have to,UNK
474,"say it was worth the effort. However, you should take heed that this film will go",UNK
475,"on for 210 minutes. If you don't have the staying power, get it on tape and",UNK
476,"watch it over a couple of nights. Now to the film, what I say will contain",UNK
477,"""spoilers"" and if you don't mind, here goes: Alexandre is a promiscuous bum, a womanizer and",UNK
478,a gigolo. He lives with an older woman called Marie. Marie owns a retail shop and,UNK
479,she provides for Alex. Alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants. The story reveals that,UNK
480,Alex had previously impregnated Gilberte whom he used to live with. Gilberte dumped him for a,UNK
481,less attractive man that she did not love because Alex had abused and battered her. At,UNK
482,"this point, Alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before",UNK
483,"he found out Gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else. By chance, Alexandre",UNK
484,meets a nurse nymph called Veronika and they striked up a relationship. Veronika fell in love,UNK
485,with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in,UNK
486,the past. Marie and Veronika struggles for Alex's affection and had a ménage à trois to,UNK
487,"boot. Finally at the end, it's revealed Veronika is pregnant with Alex's child and Alex asked",UNK
488,her to marry him. We assume (as aforesaid with Gilberte's situation) Alexandre will even get a,UNK
489,job and be the provider for his new found love and family. There is hope! With,UNK
490,"the title of ""La Maman et la putain"", I deduce Jean Eustache was relating to Françoise",UNK
491,"Lebrun's character of Veronika. She was a whore and then she became the mother. Hence, the",UNK
492,"mother and whore is the same person? Anyway, what do I know! French films are mostly",UNK
493,"(not all) very chatty, aimlessly political, preaching, theatrical, insipid, lamenting and full of quotes. Lebrun and",UNK
494,Léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the,UNK
495,script became a little lost and disjointed. Not a bad effort. 7/10.,UNK
496,What a loss the passing of director Emile Ardolino was! He could take a light script,UNK
497,"and, with the right casting and editing, put a twinkle in it and make it shine",UNK
498,like a star. This particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as great,UNK
499,"romances go, but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end. You",UNK
500,really want to know how things are going to work out. The script is perfect for,UNK
501,"Cybill Shepherd, who at the time needed to capitalize on her ""Moonlighting"" success for the new",UNK
502,generation who was (fortunately for her) probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she,UNK
503,had after a very promising start. In this film she's every bit back in form as,UNK
504,a still-pining widow living vicariously through her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson on the cusp of stardom,UNK
505,"which would peak with ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" two years later). She may have looked too young",UNK
506,"for the role, but that works well for the way the story unfolds. This is her",UNK
507,"film, but she doesn't overstep her bounds as a lead. SHepherd graciously allows Robert Downey Jr.",UNK
508,to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had,UNK
509,in his previous films to that point. And there's ample support from Ryan O'Neal (in his,UNK
510,"best role in years) and Christopher MacDonald. Masterson's natural charm pretty much coasts on its own,",UNK
511,either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of,UNK
512,fresh air with every word. Ardolino makes good use of his cast's sex appeal the same,UNK
513,"way he did with ""Dirty Dancing"", but this film is not quite as sizzling so you",UNK
514,could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room. (Use,UNK
515,"your best judgment, they're your parents after all.) I give this film a high mark because",UNK
516,"it is very user friendly, romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime, and those who are",UNK
517,"just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as well. Again, credit",UNK
518,goes to Emile Ardolino for making the most of a charming script by Randy and Perry,UNK
519,"Howze. (Where are they now?) Ardolino's next film would be the phoned-in sequel to ""Three Men",UNK
520,"and A Baby"" but his final theatrical release (Sister Act) would finally give him the nine-figure-grossing",UNK
521,"smash hit he deserved. Mr. Ardolino, your cinematic touch IS missed!",UNK
522,I thought this move was very good. There were a few things that were less than,UNK
523,"perfect, but overall, I was quite surprised. The courtroom scene in the end seemed a little",UNK
524,"unrealistic, but was real enough to be entertaining. I found that the movie communicated the hardships",UNK
525,of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it. Being a military,UNK
526,pilot I could relate to many of these parts.,UNK
527,i thought this movie was really really great! Helena did an amazing job in it! I,UNK
528,thought she played her character very well! she's an AWESOME actress!! :) the movie was also,UNK
529,really funny too! The jokes were great! i couldnt stop laughing! :) i think everyone should,UNK
530,see it... :),UNK
531,"This is a quirky little movie, and I have to agree that there is some quirky",UNK
532,acting in it as well. It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that,UNK
533,"he wants to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist, and is partly about following his dream,",UNK
534,"partly about the dreams of others, and all about the travails of showbiz. I thought the",UNK
535,"movie was charming, and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the",UNK
536,"whole thing worthwhile. Alan Arkin is terrific as the magician who never was, and his mentoring",UNK
537,"of Max makes for a funny and touching relationship. Not for everyone, probably, but if you",UNK
538,"like movies about the journey, then I think you'll like this one.",UNK
539,"This is a great example of a good, dumb movie. No, it is not high art",UNK
540,by any means. Nor is the script anywhere close to a Woody Allen or Mel Brooks.,UNK
541,BUT SO WHAT! The Killer Tomatoes series (four movies and a cartoon series) are basically good-natured,UNK
542,romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the Zuckers ruled before they switched to making,UNK
543,"serious flicks. As the title suggests, this fourth installment of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy deals with",UNK
544,"the Killer Tomatoes plot against France. In this case, Professor Gangrene (John Astin's 3rd time in",UNK
545,the role) has a plan to rule France through an ancient prophecy about the return of,UNK
546,"the rightful King of France. Steve Lundquist returns as Igor, a humanoid tomato who wants to",UNK
547,be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long-lost true,UNK
548,"King of France. Obviously he also plays the aforementioned l-l t K of F, happily skewering",UNK
549,"the French language. Opposing them is the fearless Fuzzy Tomato (like the others, FT was introduced",UNK
550,in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon) and his human,UNK
551,"allies. Mark Price, recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the FAMILY TIES series,",UNK
552,"plays a thinly disguised version of himself, passing himself as ""Michael J Fox"" as a way",UNK
553,"to win the girl of his dreams. And Angela Visser is a dream as Marie, gleefully",UNK
554,bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis. Oh that the former Miss Netherlands had had,UNK
555,more of a film career! Another returning member of the Killer Tomatoes stock company is Rick,UNK
556,"Rockwell (now best known as the hapless title subject of ""Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?"").",UNK
557,"Like co-creator John De Bello, Rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in",UNK
558,"this series. What can you say about Jon De Bello? Not much, really, except that he",UNK
559,"had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and, having done that, has apparently",UNK
560,"dropped into obscurity. John, if you ever see this, thanks for giving us the Killer Tomatoes.",UNK
561,The script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie. Like RETURN,UNK
562,"OF THE KILLER TOMATOES, the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of",UNK
563,the film crew. And Mark Price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack,UNK
564,of success compared to his former costar Michael J Fox. This is the biggest budgeted of,UNK
565,"all the Killer Tomatoes flicks and is a nice send-off to the series. Okay, the show",UNK
566,"then moved to Fox Kids as a cartoon series (which was also quite clever), but cartoons",UNK
567,just aren't the same.,UNK
568,"This was a must see documentary for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004, so",UNK
569,I was definitely going to watch the repeat. I really sympathised with the main character of,UNK
570,"the film, because, this is true, I have a milder condition of the skin problem he",UNK
571,"had, Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). This is a sad, sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about",UNK
572,a boy with a terrible skin disorder. Jonny Kennedy speaks like a kid (because of wasting,UNK
573,"vocal muscle) and never went through puberty, but he is 36 years old. Most sympathising moments",UNK
574,"are seeing his terrible condition, and pealing off his bandages. Jonny had quite a naughty sense",UNK
575,"of humour, he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin.",UNK
576,"He tells his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, his older brother and",UNK
577,"celebrity model, and Jonny's supporter, Nell McAndrew. It won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best",UNK
578,"New Director (Factual), and it was nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and the Flaherty Documentary Award.",UNK
579,It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. A must see documentary!,UNK
580,It'd be easy to call Guys and Dolls great. It's got Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando,UNK
581,"(and, contrary to Sinatra's original wishes, the casting works), it's got a really cool 1950s feel,",UNK
582,even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption. And,UNK
583,"most of the songs are often a lot of fun, and catchy, and performed with that",UNK
584,wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself. If it's not entirely,UNK
585,"as great as some others of its ilk, it shouldn't be any fault of the filmmaker",UNK
586,"Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Not all the songs entirely click, and a little of the dialog feels",UNK

588,times- Brando and Sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to,UNK
589,"tell when one plays for the camera or for the ""stage"", while the actress playing Adele",UNK
590,is better for stage than screen). The plot is one of those winners that works well,UNK
591,"for its period, even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of",UNK
592,"1999's She's All That (well, not quite, but close). A gambler (and 14-year betrothed), played by",UNK

596,"with fellow gambler Brando, who's put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission",UNK
597,"worker. It allows for the predictable twists in the story, in the sudden turn-on-turn-off of the",UNK
598,"charms of the character, of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets (gangsters and dancers and",UNK

600,"about this whole world of guys and dolls, and how to balance one or the other-",UNK
601,"obviously without getting married or too compromised. Mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece,",UNK
602,"even when keeping still with the camera on the subject, and his stars are properly reeled",UNK
603,"in. Hell, even Brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply THE",UNK

605,"wind down to what you'd hope will happen, and that's fine. All we ask for- and",UNK
606,"what we get- is entertainment in good spurts of witty, involving dialog, and a few songs",UNK

613,"meets and befriends Rico ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless-looking man who lives in an apparently",UNK
614,condemned building. There isn't much of a story as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes,UNK
615,"destined to bring forth not only Joe Buck's plights in the City, but also inter-cut to",UNK
616,his past and show us in shock cuts and semi-psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past:,UNK

618,"mother, and his apparent abuse by his grandmother, who also had a habit of hustling men",UNK
619,for money. An air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as Nilsson,UNK
620,"plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery ""Everybody's Talking'""; we feel that even while we",UNK
621,"want Joe to eventually make his mark in the City, the odds are high he won't",UNK

623,shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man,UNK
624,work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself. We know,UNK
625,from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this. A dark,UNK
626,"story of dashed hopes, John Schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of",UNK
627,"the 60s, and at the center, the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to",UNK
628,make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life.,UNK
629,There is the implied notion that they may have been lovers -- Ratso's reaching out to,UNK

673,"The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but",UNK
674,"whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic, this is more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly",UNK
675,weak SF premise. For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going,UNK
676,"to love it. Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki's attention to detail, and",UNK
677,"his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, though still",UNK
678,"not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa.",UNK
679,I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque',UNK
680,anime style. Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates. They provide the comic,UNK
681,"element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure. There",UNK
682,"was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it. Still. having",UNK
683,"said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even",UNK
684,if she's basically a female Long John Silver. Don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'Treasure,UNK
685,Planet' at times) and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub. The English,UNK
686,"voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually. However something started going pear-shaped for",UNK
687,me about this movie by about the halfway mark. I think the best way that I,UNK
688,could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the,UNK
689,"story. I'll come back to that later. There is so much to admire about Laputa, and",UNK
690,"so many people obviously love it, that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8",UNK
691,"out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'. It was more impressive",UNK
692,"than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag. The crucial thing",UNK
693,for me was this: I really found that I didn't care much about any of the,UNK
694,"characters. Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for",UNK
695,"them, rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked",UNK
696,at the amazing vistas in the movie. Even that would have been tolerable if there was,UNK
697,"some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a",UNK
698,lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls down as far as,UNK
699,"I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10",UNK
700,"movie. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in",UNK
701,"general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty",UNK
702,"dire 'Great Mouse Detective'. Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and",UNK
703,"you should definitely see it, but I do feel it's over-rated. I definitely prefer the earlier",UNK

721,though I actually would have liked to have seen them feature her even more in this.,UNK
722,"The plot in this film is a bit silly, but nevertheless, I found the film to",UNK
723,be entertaining and fun.,UNK
724,"Pleasant story of the community of Pimlico in London who, after an unexploded WW2 bomb explodes,",UNK
725,find a Royal Charter stating that the area they live in forms part of Burgundy. This,UNK
726,movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up,UNK
727,"our own rules and not having to listen to THEM. A solid cast of British stalwarts,",UNK
728,"especially Stanley Holloway, makes this more believable. There are some very nice moments in the film,",UNK
729,such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other Londoners on the other,UNK
730,side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to them. Even though you,UNK
731,"always knew Pimlico would become part of the UK again, the people of PImlico and as",UNK
732,"a consequence the viewer doesn't mind when this happens, leaving a nice happy feeling. It's amazing",UNK
733,to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in London still remain so,UNK
734,popular over fifty years later. The producers must have got something right.,UNK
735,"I adored this movie. Not only because I am a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu, although",UNK
736,he is in practically all German movies that count. But also because he is NOT the,UNK
737,"main actor. The lead is taken over by Barnaby Metschurat, who was the only reason to",UNK
738,"watch 2001's Julietta, and who really carries this movie on his shoulders. A family moves from",UNK

740,"labor in steel and coal industries. However, they end up opening a restaurant and the journey",UNK
741,the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny,UNK
742,"and charming. From this point onward, the story told is mainly that of the two brothers",UNK
743,"of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream to become a filmmaker is threatened",UNK
744,by rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is,UNK
745,a great - and totally neutral - look at what life can become formed by the,UNK
746,"choices you make. In the end, this movie doesn't say which life (Gigi's or Giancarlo's) was",UNK
747,more successful or fuller or more interesting. It merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what,UNK
748,it must be like to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved. and,UNK
749,"this look is not driven by bitterness or disdain to either country, which makes it such",UNK
750,a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from immigration. The,UNK
751,fact that director Fatih Akin's moved to Germany from Turkey in the 70s also lends this,UNK
752,movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy. The icing on the cake are,UNK
753,"fantastic performances by the entire cast, especially Metschurat and - this I really need to stress",UNK
754,- the little boy who plays young Gigi. That kid's performance would be a hard act,UNK
755,"to follow by just about anyone! Great movie, go see it.",UNK
756,What a master piece. To take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future.,UNK
757,This film is satire of the highest order. In my humble opinion it outranks Dr. Strangelove.,UNK

759,"and Market, The west! outstanding. The Clever use of gen Joxs, was ahead of its time.",UNK
760,only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering. Robot joxs tackled the issue head,UNK
761,on in 1989. The message of this film is about the comradeship of the humble man,UNK
762,and how it can overcome the wishes of government. This movies screams DON'T DO IT YOU,UNK
763,FOOLS YOU'LL KILL US ALL. EXCELLENT 10/10,UNK
764,"Still the definitive program about the Second World War, The World At War isn't just long,",UNK
765,"but also very informative. The series contains 26 episodes (each episode lasts for about 45 min.),",UNK
766,and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. Most,UNK
767,"episodes are about the war in Europe, and there are several episodes about the war in",UNK
768,"the Pacific. Other episodes include information about the wars in Africa, Burma, the Atlantic and the",UNK
769,"home fronts of Germany, Great Britain, United States and Soviet Union. There is one episode that's",UNK
770,"dedicated to the Holocaust. The series starts off with the episode A New Germany (1933-1939), and",UNK
771,tells about the rise of the Nazis in Germany and German territorial gains prior to the,UNK
772,outbreak of war. The series ends with the episode Remember; the war's influence in a post-war,UNK
773,world. Remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. Every episode begins with a,UNK
774,short introduction and then with opening credits. The credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme.,UNK
775,There are many fitting music pieces throughout the series. Each episode is like a mini-film. The,UNK
776,"footage is fantastic, and so is the way it was put together. In addition, some of",UNK
777,the footage is in color. The information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining. The,UNK
778,"series was produced by Jeremy Isaacs for Thames Television (UK). Commissioned in 1969, it took four",UNK
779,"years to produce, such was the depth of its research. The series was narrated by Laurence",UNK
780,Olivier (one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century). The series interviewed,UNK
781,"leading members of the Allied and Axis campaigns, including eyewitness accounts by civilians, enlisted men, officers",UNK
782,"and politicians, amongst them Albert Speer, Karl Donitz, Jimmy Stewart, Bill Mauldin, Curtis LeMay, Lord Mountbatten,",UNK
783,"Alger Hiss, Toshikazu Kase, Arthur Harris, Charles Sweeney, Paul Tibbets, Traudl Junge and historian Stephen Ambrose.",UNK
784,"Jeremy Isaacs says in ""The Making of The World at War"" that he sought to interview,",UNK
785,"not necessarily the surviving big names, but their aides and assistants. The most difficult subject to",UNK
786,"locate and persuade to be interviewed, according to Isaacs, was Heinrich Himmler's adjutant, Karl Wolff. The",UNK
787,latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in Himmler's presence. The World At War is often,UNK
788,considered to be the definitive television history of the Second World War. Some consider it the,UNK
789,finest example of the documentary form. In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes,UNK
790,"drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, The World",UNK
791,at War ranked 19th. The program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the,UNK
792,war. After watching a few episodes I liked the series so much that I tried to,UNK
793,watch the remaining episodes one after the other. I've seen some of them several times. There,UNK
794,are two other great documentary series that I know of that may be of interest to,UNK
795,the viewer. One is called The Great War (1964) that's about World War I. The other,UNK
796,is called Cold War (1998) that's about the Cold War obviously.,UNK
797,"After 'Aakrosh' , this was the second film for Govind Nihalani as a director.Till this movie",UNK
798,was made there was no audience for documentaries in India.This movie proved a point that a,UNK
799,documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence. It was one,UNK
800,of the successful movies in the year in which it was released. This movie contested against,UNK
801,"the big banners of the bollywood like'COOLIE', 'BETAAB','HERO' in 1983. SmithaPatel, in this movie acted more",UNK
802,like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was,UNK
803,there to remind him. She was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff,UNK
804,"of running around the trees and shrubs.At one time,she even gave up her love when the",UNK
805,"hero's ruthlessness touched the roof top. There was another character in this movie, which was played",UNK
806,"by Om Puri contemporary, Naseeruddin Shah.He played as an inspector-turned-alcoholic character.The role conveyed the message of",UNK
807,the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which,UNK
808,"also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero's ending. In his debut film,Sadashiv Amrapurkar",UNK
809,captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by,UNK
810,the filmfare.The cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able,UNK
811,to adjust to the system to an extent. The anger which left half handedly continued in,UNK
812,"Govind Nihalani's other film ""Drohkaal"". Even after two decades, this movie is remembered just because of",UNK
813,the director and the entire crew. Each one played their part par excellence.,UNK
814,Considering the lack of art with in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The Idea offers,UNK
815,a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers. But the funny thing is,UNK
816,this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short. But it,UNK
817,is the unstated assertion of independence from these themes that is most sticking. The genre is,UNK
818,"unique and not the typical expectation. It is almost this departure which first catches the eye,",UNK
819,so watching it twice is critical. The film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self,UNK
820,to the true art of cinema. And it is this true art that with an African,UNK
821,"voice that is extremely rare. The film doesn't copy to attain its message, it innovates and",UNK
822,"provokes by pulling at subtle stereotypes (not racial but character based stereotypes), From a writers perspective",UNK
823,the film is brilliant. It carries multiply messages which include a very rapid character development. It,UNK
824,must be remember this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish character,UNK
825,very quickly. The usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended. But considering,UNK
826,"the director, Owen Alik Shahadah's last venture 500 Years Later, music is to be expected. But",UNK
827,from a theme point-of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire,UNK
828,eludes indirectly to a social problembrilliant stuff!,UNK
829,The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally,UNK
830,"dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template,",UNK
831,"we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect",UNK
832,"for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be",UNK
833,considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being,UNK
834,"trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting take, by centring its account on",UNK
835,"a cocky dissident named Bozz (played outstandingly well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power",UNK
836,"governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity.",UNK
837,"Around this character, a taught, gripping plot has been constructed, and it's also a plus that",UNK
838,"the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other",UNK
839,"film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is",UNK
840,"not a film of staggering originality, it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout: the best",UNK

890,"any other film from 2005. It is a wacky film with an unforgettable character, played to",UNK
891,perfection by Pierce Brosnan. Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a facilitator (hit-man) who specializes in high-end corporate,UNK
892,gigs (assassinating rich dudes). He is also experiencing something akin to a mid-life crisis. After coming,UNK
893,"to realization that he has no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he",UNK
894,stumbles into a Mexican hotel bar one night and runs into Danny Wright (Kinnear). Danny is,UNK
895,a down-on-his-luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that,UNK
896,"just might turn things around for him. He loves his wife dearly, especially so since they",UNK
897,"lost their young son a few years earlier. The two men are chalk and cheese, hardly",UNK
898,any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night. And,UNK

904,one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade. He could shoot your,UNK
905,"mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you'd probably forgive him. Brosnan may be cinema's ultimate charmer,",UNK

912,"even more. And yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes, most",UNK
913,"of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns. However, when Julian",UNK
914,"thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday, or when",UNK

921,The third Fred MacMurray/Carole Lombard film is a bit more serious than Hands Across the Table,UNK
922,and The Princess Comes Across. It's yet another adaption of the play Burlesque which apparently was,UNK
923,popular back in the day. The original play Burlesque ran on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season,UNK
924,for 372 performances and it's the role that Carole Lombard plays that Barbara Stanwyck originated on,UNK
925,Broadway that brought her to Hollywood. A version starred Nancy Carroll in the early days of,UNK
926,talkies and later on Betty Grable and Dan Dailey did still another version of it in,UNK
927,When My Baby Smiles At Me. In fact I have a vinyl album of a radio,UNK
928,version that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler did for the Lux Radio Theater. That's an interesting,UNK
929,"work, believe me. Anyway MacMurray and Lombard do fine by the old chestnut, the story is",UNK
930,now set in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpeter.,UNK
931,Note a nice performance by Dorothy Lamour as the Latin vixen who gets between Fred and,UNK
932,Carole. Also Anthony Quinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on the,UNK
933,"make for Lombard. Swing High, Swing Low holds up real nice today and I wouldn't be",UNK

935,The wonderfully urbane Ronald Coleman is show-cased here as in few other of his films. He,UNK
936,"is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him, not in",UNK
937,"spite of him. He is handsome, witty and very clever here as he remains a step",UNK
938,"ahead of his wandering, lovely wife--played perfectly by Anna Lee. The movie is based on a",UNK
939,french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce. Most of the supporting cast,UNK
940,"is well known, at least by face if not name...and are absolutely perfect for this very",UNK
941,funny film. The fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable as,UNK
942,he stays a step ahead of the other characters. His multi-talents can be further appreciated in,UNK
943,"the classic ""Lost Horizon"" which every film buff must see.",UNK
944,Both visually and musically stunning. A treat for both the eye and the ear. The quintessential,UNK
945,"Victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting, helping to create a Christmas scene of",UNK
946,which Dickens himself would have been justifiably proud. Technically the production is visually stimulating and the,UNK
947,special effects are both imaginatively devised and creatively achieved in a traditional stage setting. The dancing,UNK
948,of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good. The photography and lighting are first class,UNK
949,and the sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills employed. A great,UNK

974,This Showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4.5; I gave it,UNK
975,a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars. After reading the,UNK

977,"Yeah, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy/Drama under Genre. That sure is misleading, isn't",UNK

979,"that expectation. In fact, based on the synopsis of what I heard, I fully expected it",UNK
980,to simply be a Drama. I'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie,UNK
981,caused so many low votes. Another factor that might have caused low votes is that this,UNK
982,movie is very much 'character-driven'. 'Driving Miss Daisy' is an example of another character-driven movie that,UNK
983,comes to mind. Someone's previous comment complained about a boring trial. Tom's (Danny Glover) work scenes,UNK
984,"seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie. That is, how he was engineering",UNK
985,"the upward social climb of his family - or his personal troops, if you will. However,",UNK
986,they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to Greenwich and move,UNK
987,'up' in the world. Tom's obsession became a compulsion. He proved that he would stop at,UNK
988,nothing to blend into the white neighborhood. His chagrin when another black person moved next door,UNK
989,was not due to skin color. It was because of everything the 'interloper' represented; everything that,UNK
990,"Tom had left behind. In essence, Tom had become an Oreo cookie: Black on the outside",UNK
991,but White on the inside. The last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most,UNK
992,"powerfully written, directed and acted (by Whoopi Goldberg) I have ever had the pleasure to witness.",UNK
993,I realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next,UNK
994,door (don't want to give it away). The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I,UNK
995,am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs Tom which college Tom,UNK
996,"-Two is going to or when she releases it, all in the middle of the night",UNK
997,"and Tom wakes up. Nevertheless, the denouement is great. You know that life on that street",UNK
998,"will never be the same. My favorite kind of character-driven flick: people go through problems, some",UNK

1002,"relief to have one in an urban school, with naturalistic, realistic Latinos and believable use of",UNK
1003,Brooklyn project settings. It made me realize that virtually all Hollywood high school movies are set,UNK
1004,"in luxurious suburbia or small towns. (Even the somewhat comparable ""Love and Basketball"" which focused on",UNK
1005,"teen African-Americans was set in suburbia.) While these kids share some of the same peer problems,",UNK
1006,"those issues shrink compared to the other struggles of these kids, where high school graduation could",UNK
1007,"be the major accomplishment of their lives. The feminist element here is riveting in its originality,",UNK
1008,as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationship--and a victory-- on,UNK
1009,her terms. A lots of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to rise,UNK

1011,"no cheap thrills ""Rocky"" fight movie, as the practices and fights have complex outcomes, and all",UNK

1020,Easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century. In Cold Blood is brilliant,UNK
1021,"in the simplicity and realism of its storytelling, and absolutely riveting. Robert Blake walks away with",UNK
1022,"the film. The story seems to be presented almost entirely from Perry's viewpoint, despite Dick being",UNK
1023,the leader and planner of the pair. The viewer will invariable perceive Dick as being more,UNK
1024,"unstable, immature, and generally feel like Perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but",UNK
1025,for Dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score. Based on,UNK
1026,"a true story with particular attention to accuracy, In Cold Blood depicts the story behind the",UNK
1027,"brutal and senseless murder of a rural Kansas family one cold, windy night, because Dick has",UNK
1028,bought into an age-old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in,UNK
1029,"their home. As ""prosecutor"" (a character that isn't given a name in the script), played by",UNK
1030,"Will Geer, so astutely points out, their lives are bought for only $10 a head. Director",UNK
1031,Richard Brooks wisely chooses not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until,UNK

1033,the lives of Dick and Perry slowly unravel as they attempt to escape not only being,UNK
1034,"apprehended by law enforcement, but also Perry's own ever-escalating sense of impending doom. He repeatedly makes",UNK
1035,"remarks, ""No one ever gets away with a thing like that,"" and ""I can't help thinking",UNK
1036,"we left something behind that belongs to us."" Dick is neither mature nor moral enough to",UNK
1037,"feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime, only irritation at Perry's. Indeed, after they",UNK
1038,"are caught, it is Dick who breaks first, and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable",UNK
1039,proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime. I felt somewhat sorry,UNK
1040,"for Perry from the very beginning of the film, and more-so as events progressed, but I",UNK
1041,only loathed Dick. The genius of the film is the engaging manner in which the story,UNK
1042,"is played. We do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters, but",UNK
1043,"that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred. The story is unrelenting,",UNK
1044,"taunt, the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few",UNK
1045,"minutes. For those of you who are interested in such things, I noticed a couple of",UNK
1046,"the ""Goofs"" listed here on the IMDb page for In Cold Blood are incorrect or exaggerated.",UNK
1047,"Such as the ""reversed"" process shot, at the beginning of the film, as Dick and Perry",UNK
1048,"are driving across the bridge into Kansas. To begin with, this isn't even a process shot,",UNK
1049,the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield,UNK
1050,of the car is real. A large cargo truck located to the left front of Dick's,UNK

1052,"greater rate of speed, but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and",UNK
1053,"it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle. As I previously stated, this is",UNK
1054,"one of the ten best works of 20th century cinema, not recommended for the very young",UNK
1055,due to some course language and implied and inferred violence (no actual in your face gore,UNK
1056,"as a modern film would resort to), but a thoroughly excellent film.",UNK
1057,A great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat,UNK
1058,to watch and enjoy. Director-writer Brian de Palma does a super Hitchcock-imitation (many called it a,UNK
1059,"""ripoff"") with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the",UNK
1060,camera-work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-TV tapes).,UNK
1061,"The downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard,",UNK
1062,"is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis",UNK
1063,Franz (who has hair here!). The opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower,UNK
1064,"scene of Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. The film",UNK
1065,has several erotic scenes in it as Dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups),UNK
1066,and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their bodies. There is not much dialog in,UNK
1067,the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder.,UNK
1068,"The first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is, it's",UNK
1069,"still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through, particularly for males ogling",UNK
1070,the naked women.,UNK
1071,"Shamefully, before I saw this film, I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter. I had to",UNK
1072,"do some research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted, as was her character,",UNK
1073,"with (well?), what she was afflicted with. I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady.",UNK
1074,She pulled it of flawlessly. Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final,UNK
1075,"wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, could be interpreted as tender, and romantic? Well,",UNK
1076,"they can be, when the right performers present them in the proper manner, as they did",UNK
1077,in this wonderful movie. I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looked in this,UNK
1078,movie. I have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the,UNK
1079,"face of our earth, but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie.",UNK
1080,I hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as I did.,UNK
1081,Thank you for letting me express my opinion.,UNK
1082,"Dominion Tank Police is without a shell of a doubt, one of the most amazing shows",UNK
1083,"ever produced, but not just in the field of animation. While the first part (Acts 1",UNK
1084,"and 2) mostly consists of action and fun, the second part is more serious and one",UNK
1085,should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part. The subtleties,UNK
1086,are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant. You must have an,UNK
1087,extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second Part (Acts-3 and 4). I,UNK
1088,"do have some complaints though. In the first part, the Tank Bonaparte quite literally jumps over",UNK
1089,a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all. One might also question,UNK
1090,the plausibility of Bonaparte jumping on the wing of Helicopter Gunship even though it was cool.,UNK
1091,Buaku rules.,UNK
1092,"A beautiful new print of ""Zabriskie Point"" is playing in Paris and seems to be doing",UNK
1093,well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full evaluation of the film. Let's hope,UNK
1094,"that the new print means that a DVD with some insightful ""extras"" will be out in",UNK
1095,the near future. I remember watching ZP when it came out and thought it was a,UNK
1096,"crashing bore. This time around I was totally awed and would classify it as a ""near-miss""",UNK
1097,"masterpiece. The first part of the movie is a time capsule of late '60's Los Angeles,",UNK
1098,"I lived there then, and Antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the",UNK
1099,place. Kudos to production designer Dean Tavoularis who found some incredible locations and did outstanding work.,UNK
1100,The print I saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes. It is forbidden to those under 16,UNK
1101,"(or 18, I can't remember). I suspect there is quite a bit of restored footage in",UNK
1102,this print. SPOILER -- I wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut.,UNK
1103,What appears today seems rather tame by current standards. There is no soundtrack music until almost,UNK
1104,"1 hour into the film. Before we hear extraneous noise such as radio broadcasts, etc. Antonioni",UNK
1105,was very daring to do this. I remember how much was made at the time of,UNK
1106,the lack of acting skills of non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette did,UNK
1107,not bother me. Halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the film continues. Much of the,UNK
1108,student riot footage looks like stock footage to me. One shot is in a different aspect,UNK
1109,"ratio & distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there is actual staged footage, but not",UNK
1110,all that much. I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni did some of the shots,UNK
1111,of Frechette flying the plane. It looks like he really did some of the flying -,UNK
1112,there's no blue screen or double in some shots. I hope to get back to see,UNK

1117,"this is somewhat similar to his own ""Repulsion"" from ten years earlier, but the tone is",UNK
1118,"completely different. ""The Tenant"" manages to balance darker than dark absurdity (I'm a bit hesitant on",UNK
1119,"calling it humor, even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny) with some",UNK
1120,"truly suspenseful paranoia. Polanski was always a master at building unease, and moments in this film",UNK
1121,are almost unbearably creepy. The overall weirdness of the film is also a plus. In addition,UNK
1122,"to Polanski's exquisite as usual direction, the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions.",UNK
1123,"Polanski the actor is often overshadowed by Polanski the director, but his performance here truly captures",UNK
1124,his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast. The themes of social discrimination make this,UNK
1125,film more than just strangeness for the sake of being strange. The rest of the cast,UNK
1126,"offers strong performances also, especially Isabelle Adjani's sympathetic turn, and Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters' appropriately",UNK
1127,"annoying ones. ""The Tenant"" is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise",UNK

1223,"Stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of Lily Powers (notice the moniker), a part that",UNK
1224,"called for just the right amount of sexuality coated with power, cunning, and revenge, yet tinged",UNK
1225,"with virginal pretense when called for, a very difficult portrayal to make convincing. Barbara Stanwyck conveys",UNK
1226,"the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top (literally), she",UNK
1227,still has good in her heart--note the way she treats those few who have been kind,UNK
1228,to her such as Chico (the marvelous actress Theresa Harris) and the old philosopher. And though,UNK

1250,"""Hatred of a Minute"" is arguably one of the better films to come out of Michigan",UNK
1251,"in recent years. Not to say that it's a brilliant film by any means, but it's",UNK
1252,"definitely worth a watch. ""Hatred"" chronicles the sordid adventures of Eric Seaver (played by director Kallio),",UNK
1253,"a formerly abused child now grown up, and starting to listen to his evil side. ""Hatred""",UNK
1254,"is very nice visually. The shots are creative, and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting",UNK
1255,"to look at. This film actually has an element of production value to it, unlike other",UNK
1256,"recent Michigan releases like ""Dark Tomorrow"" and ""Biker Zombies."" Subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition",UNK
1257,"show good use of this film's $350,000 budget. However, ""Hatred"" stumbles in the same places that",UNK
1258,"so many other local films do, and that's in the story and character department. Essentially, things",UNK
1259,"just kind-of happen. Eric Seaver doesn't evolve at all. Basically, he's always been crazy, it's just",UNK
1260,that people are starting to notice. The film just wanders along its merry way with very,UNK
1261,"little development. Also, the ending is very abrupt. However- since this is a horror film, since",UNK
1262,"when do we care about plot? We just want to see people die, and ""Hatred"" certainly",UNK
1263,"delivers. As the body count mounted, people in the theater started cheering ""Kill her! Kill em'",UNK

1274,This is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie. There are many plots and turns. The story,UNK

1276,people. This film is very well directed by Arne Glimcher and the fine sound of James,UNK
1277,Newton Howard is excellent. Strong performance of Sean Connery and Ed Harris. If you liked this,UNK

1279,One of the less widely lauded of recent Asian period action affairs Gojoe is an at,UNK
1280,"first slow and often curious but overall pretty terrific offering, exciting, layered and beautiful. I'm sad",UNK
1281,to say I know virtually nothing of the Buddhist philosophy or Japanese history and legend that,UNK
1282,"surrounds this film so its deeper meanings are lost on me, but even without contextual knowledge",UNK
1283,"this is still rich fare, taking a traditional fantasy structure into a, impactful higher plane. The",UNK
1284,"story is of Benkei, a warrior monk and perhaps demon who seeks enlightenment by destroying the",UNK
1285,"demon of Gojoe Bridge: Prince Shanao, himself a mortal seeker after his own higher plane but",UNK
1286,this time the power of demons. Thus the film becomes a matter of illusions and in,UNK
1287,"Benkei's case, indecision, a conflict in which the real goal is self knowledge, for Benkei to",UNK
1288,come to terms with his true nature and for Prince Shanao to come face to face,UNK
1289,with the nature of what he seeks to become. Benkei is even more hampered here by,UNK
1290,"the fact that his dark nature makes him fundamentally at odds with the world, even when",UNK
1291,not in open conflict he is never at ease. Director Sogo Ishii handles this one as,UNK
1292,"an epic, with measured pace, camera work always stylish and often frenzied, without neglecting the need",UNK
1293,"for more sedate moments to let the location sink in, there is also great use of",UNK
1294,"lighting and fog to give an ethereal atmosphere, there is an air of fantasy to much",UNK
1295,of the film but outside of the overtly supernatural moments it is a down and dirty,UNK
1296,fantasy with more period fell than flights of fancy. The cinematography of Makoto Watanbe is important,UNK
1297,"here, vivid and detailed, a richly evocative affair. Actingwise Daisuke Ryu is dignified and powerful with",UNK
1298,"a mysterious savagery as Benkei, while Tadanobu Asano has a driven, cold arrogance as Prince Shanao.",UNK
1299,"Of the leads Masatoshi Nagase rounds things out as an ordinary man, smart and cynical but",UNK
1300,"still unaware of just exactly what the stakes are. The film all fits together well, it",UNK
1301,"is however a touch flabby at times, it begins slowly, some shots are a little drawn",UNK
1302,out and the epic fight scenes at times go on longer than strictly necessary. As for,UNK
1303,"the fighting it is filmed frenetic rather than for actual moves, it has artistic impact but",UNK
1304,"may disappoint regular action fans, often obscured by objects, flashing blades and fast moving individuals, whirling",UNK
1305,"with deadly force through their adversaries are the order of the day, it is invigorating to",UNK
1306,watch but in the end I could have done with a little more traditionalism. There is,UNK
1307,"some unfortunate cgi bloodshed as well, it somewhat works in the context but is still distracting.",UNK
1308,"Overall though I found this to be a pretty great film, its not one for regular",UNK
1309,"action fans or swordplay enthusiasts seeking another Azumi, rather a deeper and more mystical beast, its",UNK
1310,ending in particular will not go down well with fans of the more generic wing of,UNK
1311,such fare. But as for myself it really hit the spot and for those more adventurously,UNK
1312,inclined it might do so too. Well recommended at any rate.,UNK
1313,A beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of archaic Celticism. Setting the story,UNK
1314,"around the famous Book of Kels, believed to have been comprised by monks from the small",UNK
1315,"island of Iona, off the western coast of Scotland. Telling the tale of a young abbots",UNK
1316,"apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, the fierce headless horseman of",UNK
1317,pagan mythology. In hopes of recovering a lost artefact. The films true beauty lies in its',UNK
1318,animation. Cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look,UNK
1319,of seem less simplicity. Deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant Cartoon Network series,UNK
1320,"'Samurai Jack' for its genius use of mark making and background depth, The Secret of Kels",UNK
1321,creates a consistently affective Celtic world living under the shadow of Viking invasion. The history may,UNK
1322,be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly,UNK
1323,irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and Celtic-revivalist mysticism. The girl,UNK
1324,of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it,UNK
1325,"is, as she glides from branch to branch. Appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with",UNK
1326,qualities resembling the legendary Cheshire Cat from Alice and Wonderland. The Secret of Kels is an,UNK
1327,"absolute treat. For all genders, all ages, it's a lovely piece of family cinema. Don't expect",UNK
1328,to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed!,UNK
1329,Full House came to me when I was about 9. I remember seeing re-runs of America's,UNK
1330,"Funniest Home Videos with Bob Saget, and one day my mom told me that he was",UNK
1331,"also in a show called Full House. One day, I was lucky enough to catch an",UNK
1332,"episode while visiting family. It didn't seem too interesting at first, but as I watched more",UNK
1333,"and more, ever night at 9:00, I would just be so into it. This show really",UNK
1334,"makes you want to be there yourself, hang out with the girls, go places with them,",UNK
1335,"and maybe even join in their little family ""sing-alongs"". The thing I like most about Full",UNK
1336,House is that it's a great show for kids AND adults of all ages. There will,UNK
1337,"be some parts that are more for adults, then parts that are meant for kids, so",UNK
1338,"that the whole family will enjoy it. No matter how cheesy it can be, it's still",UNK
1339,"a great show, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. 10/10",UNK
1340,This is a great example of a rather simple Film Noir story that is handled exceptionally,UNK
1341,well--thanks to excellent direction by Otto Preminger as well as some lovely acting performances. Dana Andrews,UNK
1342,stars as a hot-headed detective who all too often uses his fists instead of his brains.,UNK
1343,"Soon after the film begins, Andrews is being reprimanded for this and is warned that if",UNK
1344,"this continues he'll be off the force. A bit later, while investigating a crime he's attacked",UNK
1345,by a suspect and Andrews is forced to fight to protect himself. This time he does,UNK
1346,NOT use excessive force but the assailant is killed. Andrews panics and assumes they won't believe,UNK
1347,him so he tries to cover up the death--though instead an innocent man is ultimately blamed,UNK
1348,for the crime. There's a lot more to the film than this--including a plot involving a,UNK
1349,"slimy villain (Gary Merrill) and a love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). All in all, this",UNK
1350,"is one of the better examples of the genre--with great gritty dialog, superb lighting and a",UNK
1351,simple yet very effective story. This is the way Noir was meant to be.,UNK
1352,Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for last! I've heard a lot of people complain,UNK
1353,"about they way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to",UNK
1354,the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say to that is...are you kidding me? Come,UNK
1355,on it was not that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes to,UNK
1356,"feel more realistic, which I would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest",UNK
1357,of the movie I really didn't even notice it. You can tell that Damon has really,UNK
1358,"gotten comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes that can be a bad thing, but",UNK
1359,in this case its a really good thing. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment.,UNK
1360,"Damon also has a great supporting cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. David",UNK
1361,"Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret",UNK
1362,"CIA organization. Even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action, they",UNK
1363,managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going,UNK
1364,"on. This film stands far above the other two Bourne movies, and is definitely one of",UNK
1365,the best movies of the 2007 summer season!,UNK
1366,"""Fido"" is to be commended for taking a tired genre, zombies, and turning it into a",UNK
1367,"most original film experience. The early 50s atmosphere is stunning, the acting terrific, and the entire",UNK
1368,production shows a lot of careful planning. Suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of,UNK
1369,"beautiful classic cars, ""Eisenhower era"" dress, art deco furniture, and zombie servants. It would be very",UNK
1370,"easy to dismiss ""Fido"" as cartoon-like fluff, similar to ""Tank Girl"", but the two movies are",UNK
1371,"vastly different. ""Fido has structure, a script that tells a story, and acting that is superior.",UNK
1372,"Make no mistake, this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have",UNK
1373,failed. Highly recommended. - MERK,UNK
1374,I gave it an 8 star rating. The story may have fallen short about 3/4 of,UNK
1375,"the way into the picture but the performances remained strong throughout.""Men of Honor"" was changed from",UNK
1376,"""Navy Diver"" understandably so. Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will",UNK
1377,"probably feel that ""Honor"" is an appropriate word to use in the title.",UNK
1378,Jackie Chan is considered by many film and martial arts movie fans as one of the,UNK
1379,greatest action stars ever to grace the silver screen and Police Story cemented his reputation as,UNK
1380,"the likely successor to the late, great Bruce Lee. If Enter The Dragon bared the so-called",UNK
1381,"bench mark of Lee's greatness in the 70s, then the same can be said about Police",UNK
1382,"Story and Jackie Chan in the 80s. Forget about the Rush Hour trilogy, or any of",UNK
1383,"his US efforts- the one film that really typifies Chan's excellence, not to mention kick starting",UNK
1384,"his status as a high kicking, bone-crushing kung- fu talisman, as well as his movie career",UNK
1385,"was this, Police Story- the first in a series of successful cop films, set in mainland,",UNK
1386,"present day Hong Kong. I've seen many of his efforts- likewise the US-based Rush Hour, Rumble",UNK
1387,"in the Bronx, The Medalian and The Tuxedo to name- and frankly many of them pale",UNK
1388,"into insignificance compared to Police Story. In those movies, we saw a less 'dumbed down' version",UNK
1389,"of Jackie, of whom didn't get the opportunity to utilise his fighting abilities to the maximum,",UNK
1390,not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts,UNK
1391,"as Drunken Master, Police Story to name. The stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are",UNK
1392,the best featured in any action movie. The shopping mall scene is literally one of a,UNK
1393,"kind and has to be seen to be believed: the flying shards of glass, Chan who",UNK
1394,is left dangling outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman frantically drives,UNK
1395,"through the streets of the town, and Chan successfully making usage of all sorts of inanimate",UNK
1396,objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with. Considering he is known,UNK
1397,"for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in harm's way, Jackie's",UNK
1398,"persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one, is somewhat",UNK
1399,of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert. Especially as he has the,UNK
1400,"bruises to show for it. Thus, he has proved that he is no one-trick pony when",UNK
1401,"it comes down to devising and coming up with various and clever looking moves. Story-wise, there",UNK
1402,"is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative, it makes up with its",UNK
1403,"end-to end action and fight sequences. As for the dialogue, well it's not a really huge",UNK
1404,aspect of the film- which is why most fans of Jackie's and martial arts films are,UNK
1405,"more interested in action, as opposed to the story. Unlike say The Matrix, there are no",UNK
1406,"wires or CGI, or any form of computer trickery involved. What you see is what you",UNK
1407,"get- and what you get with Police Story is a great Jackie Chan epic, full of",UNK
1408,"action and pulsating stunts.It is miles better than Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour and all",UNK
1409,his other American efforts. Police Story is an excellent film and one I'd definitely recommend to,UNK
1410,"anyone who is a novice Jackie Chan fan, but of whom are unsure which one they",UNK
1411,should watch first.,UNK
1412,A very cute movie with a great background provided by the city of Boston and Fenway,UNK
1413,"Park. As a baseball fan and light movie addict, it hit a homerun for me. Plenty",UNK
1414,of laughs and plenty of authentic baseball scenes with real ballplayers and real references to past,UNK
1415,Bosox failures. And how enjoyable was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme without,UNK
1416,"having to endure an overage, over-the-hill, self-serving Kevin Costner attempting to make believers out of a",UNK
1417,critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a fine job as a young love-struck couple suffering from,UNK
1418,"Jimmy's Bosox ""jones"". It was a bit whacky and out of left field, but there really",UNK
1419,are Sox fans that are that fanatic and live their lives through the fortunes of their,UNK
1420,"beloved team. The movie coasted along at a fast pace and the ending, although predictable, had",UNK
1421,"the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular movies, without being overly pretentious. Also enjoyable",UNK
1422,"was the return of Willie Garson to the screen. I miss the forever-popular ""Stanford Blatch"" from",UNK
1423,"Sex & the City. He's always funny, even when he does or says very little. So",UNK
1424,"buy yourself two box seats, some popcorn, and get ready for a fun time. ""Fever Pitch""",UNK

1426,The United States was still fighting World War II (the movie was released in between VE,UNK
1427,day and VJ day). Any studio worth its salt was either making fighting movies where fearless,UNK
1428,"American soldiers beat the enemy, or Americans in general were singing and dancing. Technicolor Musicals were",UNK
1429,what America thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed. Most musicals of the,UNK
1430,day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped,UNK
1431,in to fill time til the next musical number! I get the feeling now that the,UNK
1432,people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970. Depressing how quickly we forget. This film,UNK
1433,"could've been called ""The Search for Jose Iturbi"" but now everyone wonders why. Allow me to",UNK
1434,"explain. From 1929--his arrival in America--until his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the finest",UNK
1435,"pianists to grace a concert stage. He agreed to do a few movies in 1942, but",UNK
1436,Hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time. Not only an excellent,UNK
1437,"pianist, but a successful conductor as well, Iturbi was very much a household word for more",UNK
1438,than 40 years. The scene where Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies,UNK

1440,"who produced that movie & many other MGM musicals, credited Iturbi with interesting America's youth in",UNK
1441,classical music. Grayson's wanting an audition with Iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life,UNK
1442,"at the time. Everyone wanted Iturbi back then. The joke among soldiers was that ""GI"" meant",UNK
1443,"""Get Iturbi"" (he did a lot of concerts at military bases). Gene Kelly was a great",UNK
1444,"dancer and Frank Sinatra an excellent singer, but at the time this movie was made Sinatra",UNK
1445,was barely 30 and had only been under contract to Columbia Records for four years. Kelly,UNK
1446,"was already well-known as a dancer, but Iturbi had by then been a world-wide sensation for",UNK
1447,"20+ years. And as to the lack of a plot, Americans didn't need plot. They were",UNK
1448,"tired of war, they were sick with fear for their loved ones, and worried about the",UNK
1449,future. They needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out fine in,UNK
1450,the end. They needed music and smiles and joy and romance. This movie and others like,UNK

1458,-A very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that,UNK
1459,she connects with. As the two get on their flight and sit next to each other,UNK
1460,the young man Jack becomes deadly as he threatens Lisa to either change the room that,UNK
1461,"a politician and his wife will be staying in, or else have her father die. See",UNK
1462,"now that's what you happens when you fly coach, stuff like that never happens in first",UNK
1463,"class. -Other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight, the other thing that",UNK
1464,"this movie shares with ""Flightplan"" is the sheer unbelievability *if that's a word* of the story.",UNK
1465,The point of the whole is to get the main character to change a politician's room,UNK
1466,"so he can be assassinated which is a pretty plausible plan, but won't it have being",UNK
1467,easier for Jack to just find someone that was computer savvy and have them hack into,UNK
1468,"the hotel's system? Teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers, so I'm pretty sure",UNK
1469,it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a,UNK
1470,computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on Lisa and getting her into the,UNK
1471,predicament that she lands on in the movie. -Plus one thing that struck me as odd,UNK
1472,was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about. This,UNK
1473,is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally,UNK
1474,it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something. But I'm 100% sure,UNK
1475,that I'm reading way too much into it. The movie is meant to be as realistic,UNK
1476,"as an episode of ""24"" so one can't be perplexed by such complexities. For all my",UNK
1477,"complaints though, this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done. It's not",UNK
1478,"exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain, but at the same time it",UNK
1479,doesn't require great intelligence to fully enjoy. -I'd love to sit here in my comfy chair,UNK
1480,and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really I can't. I love Rachel,UNK
1481,"McAdams, I love Cillian Murphy, and I like Brian Cox, but they don't really stretch their",UNK
1482,acting muscles here. It's not really much of a problem since this isn't the movie that,UNK
1483,"studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting isn't the least bit horrible, just not",UNK
1484,great. Wes Craven isn't exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a,UNK
1485,"movie like this, but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to",UNK
1486,film the movie and the lack of depth to the script. It was definitely a huge,UNK
1487,"improvement over the disappointing ""Cursed"" and as much as I liked him doing something different with",UNK
1488,"this movie, I still would love for him to go back to doing what he did",UNK
1489,in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it's release.,UNK
1490,-One nice thing about the movie which I really appreciated was just how short the movie,UNK
1491,was. It is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once,UNK
1492,"in a while, but nowadays it's like every movie that comes out feels too long, where",UNK
1493,"as this movie just felt like the right length. Not too long, and too short. They",UNK
1494,don't waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this isn't,UNK
1495,the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie. Being,UNK
1496,"a huge film music geek, I have to say that the best part of the movie",UNK
1497,is the ultra cool score by Marco Beltrami. It's really nice to see Beltrami go from,UNK
1498,writing the predictable stuff to the great music he's doing now. I really the cool techno/orchestral,UNK
1499,"stuff he does for the main titles. Too bad that I can't find the soundtrack anywhere,",UNK
1500,would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime I wanted instead of having to,UNK
1501,pop in the DVD when I want to hear it. -Overall It's nice for what it,UNK
1502,"is and whiles it's far from great cinema, should still provide for some small entertaining hour",UNK
1503,and a half,UNK
1504,My kids recently started watching the reruns of this show - both the early episodes on,UNK
1505,"the N, and the later ones on ABC Family - and they love it. (I wasn't",UNK
1506,aware the show had even lasted past the first or second season) I'm curious as to,UNK
1507,"what prompted all of the cast changes - I've seen them described as ""highly publicized,"" and",UNK
1508,yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments on,UNK
1509,"how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes. (Personally, I don't see",UNK
1510,a whole lot of difference - the scripts and themes remain largely the same throughout -,UNK
1511,but they do lose some great people along the way) My daughter has put the DVDs,UNK
1512,"on her wish list, so perhaps the land of special features and commentary will shed some",UNK
1513,light on all of this. I also wish they'd done some self-referential humor about the changes,UNK
1514,"- like on ""Boy Meets World"" where they drop the little sister for an entire season",UNK
1515,"or so, and when a different actor later shows up playing her, they ask her where",UNK
1516,"she's been and she says ""upstairs,"" or when early series token geek ""Minkus"" shows up for",UNK
1517,"the high school graduation, they ask him where he's been and he says ""over there,"" pointing",UNK
1518,"to the part of the classroom never shown by the camera, before saying ""Hey, Mr. Turner,",UNK
1519,"wait up!"" and running off screen (Mr. turner being another character who left) Oh well -",UNK
1520,maybe there will be an E true Hollywood story on this or something? I was just,UNK
1521,glad to see Aunt Hilda show up for the finale - she was always one of,UNK
1522,my favorites - it's too bad it couldn't have been a more encompassing cast reunion. (The,UNK
1523,Zelda candle just didn't cut it for me),UNK
1524,"I have to say, I loved Vanishing Point. I've seen the original, and this is a",UNK
1525,pretty good remake of it. Even though it didn't follow the original storyline (that's why I,UNK
1526,"gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and this is probably a",UNK
1527,"better storyline. As for the car, well the DJ's comment at the end about the Challenger",UNK
1528,"going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable (And if you look, the speedometer needle",UNK
1529,"was wobbling at 145-150), but even though I didn't see one on the engine in one",UNK
1530,"of the beginning scenes where they show the engine, the original storyline had a supercharged Hemi,",UNK
1531,"so it's possible. For those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it, the normally aspirated",UNK
1532,"Chrysler 300C of today can go 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, going",UNK
1533,on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70,UNK
1534,"mph. Plus, in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the Challenger",UNK
1535,it would probably be more aerodynamic.,UNK
1536,One word can describe this movie and that is weird. I recorded this movie one day,UNK
1537,because it was a Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be,UNK
1538,"interesting. Well it was, the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to",UNK
1539,get a metal body so he can seek revenge. On the way he meets very colorful,UNK
1540,"characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you",UNK
1541,are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out.,UNK
1542,Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere. Australia is not immune to it. A dingo snatched a baby,UNK
1543,"and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having ""killed"" her own baby. I",UNK

1594,I've found it. It reminded me of two movies: Trainspotting (small time criminals scoring some drugs,UNK
1595,and doing some stupid things in Schotland) and The Blair Witch Project (because of the style,UNK
1596,"of filming). It's about the loyalty between two friends, one of them is coming out of",UNK

1661,"I happen to like Leslie Howard, in his better films. Yet, for some reason, his performance",UNK
1662,in OF HUMAN BONDAGE never has moved me tremendously. I first saw the film on my,UNK
1663,college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in,UNK
1664,the 1930s and 1940s Howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by Dirk Bogard as,UNK
1665,the man who was born to be betrayed. This is not usually the case (off hand,UNK
1666,"I think of Ashley Wilkes as a man who might be betrayed, if he and Scarlett",UNK
1667,"O'Hara were meant to be an item by Margaret Mitchell - but Ashley loved Melonie, not",UNK
1668,"Scarlett). Howard could play any type, and a role like R. J. Mitchell or Professor Henry",UNK
1669,Higgins is not one who is betrayed.* (*One can make the case that Philip Armstrong Scott,UNK
1670,"is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in 49TH PARALLEL, but they are",UNK
1671,"Nazis who consider him - a liberal, westerner, Canadian - fair game to double cross in",UNK
1672,"wartime. It isn't the same as emotional betrayal, and Howard does not shrivel up as a",UNK
1673,"result, but faces the Nazis and captures one after beating him up.) I think what the",UNK
1674,reviewer meant was that Howard could be soulful - or try to be soulful. Witness his,UNK
1675,"poet - dreamer - wanderer in THE PETRIFIED FORREST. But that character was not betrayed, except",UNK
1676,by history perhaps (as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster,UNK
1677,played by Humphrey Bogart). The character of Philip Carey in Somerset Maugham's OF HUMAN BONDAGE is,UNK
1678,soulful too. He is sensitive for several reasons. He has an interest in art and tries,UNK
1679,to become a painter - but unlike the artist Strickland in THE MOON AND SIXPENCE he,UNK
1680,"has no real talent. So he decides to concentrate on medical studies, accentuated by a club",UNK
1681,foot condition he has. Here he is a man with low self-esteem who is set up,UNK
1682,to be betrayed. Philip finds that betrayal in the form of Mildred a Cockney waitress (Bette,UNK
1683,Davis) who is mercenary and as selfish as they come. Why Philip falls for her is,UNK
1684,"not really addressed in the film, but he does find the woman fascinating. And she finds",UNK
1685,"him an easy meal ticket. Ironically in being so captivated by this slut, Philip fails to",UNK
1686,"notice two other women who are interested in him (Kay Johnson and Frances Dee), and are",UNK
1687,more fit to be his mate. He also keeps finding himself forgiving Davis when she has,UNK
1688,affairs with other men (Alan Hale and Reginald Denny - the latter a friend of Howard's).,UNK
1689,"Although Howard's performance captures the doormat tendency of Philip towards Mildred, he really does not show",UNK
1690,"enough passion (until late in the movie, when he turns on her). That is why I",UNK
1691,find I never cared for his performance here - it lacks any reality. His later tortured,UNK
1692,"insistence in GONE WITH THE WIND that he loves Olivia De Haviland, not Vivian Leigh, has",UNK
1693,more consistency with a man in love. But the performance of Davis as Mildred makes the,UNK
1694,"film important. She had a wide variety of parts up to 1934, like the girlfriend of",UNK
1695,the deaf pianist in THE MAN WHO PLAYED GOD or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered,UNK
1696,in FOG OVER FRISCO or the mouse-like secretary in THREE ON A MATCH. As Mildred she,UNK
1697,finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitch. Curiously her performance,UNK
1698,was not all of one note. While she uses and abuses Howard for two thirds of,UNK
1699,"the film, culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her",UNK
1700,"made her, her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating,",UNK
1701,and her inability to keep any honest jobs. When Howard rejects her the viewers fail to,UNK
1702,note how equally vicious he becomes (he asks what happened to her baby - she tells,UNK
1703,"him the baby died and Howard says brusquely that he is glad, which is hardly the",UNK
1704,"response she expects). In the end Howard does finally get his life in order, but Mildred",UNK
1705,ends a casualty (ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend Denny on a medical call).,UNK
1706,The Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences did fail to nominate Davis in 1934 (leading,UNK
1707,"to the largest write - in campaign in it's history, and a permanent change in it's",UNK
1708,"rules), but Davis was established as a star. In one year she won the Oscar as",UNK

1711,After having seen a lot of Greek movies I feel very suspicious against most of them.,UNK

1713,cannot claim that the screenplay is so great or the photography is perfect or something technical.,UNK
1714,It's a real story and it is happening in Greek rural areas in places forgotten from,UNK

1722,the end you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the society being religious and trying to,UNK
1723,"act like God says, but at the same time acting so unfairly to the King. This",UNK
1724,shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or their beliefs according to the established system. In,UNK
1725,"the end you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story, meaning that you",UNK
1726,can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of,UNK
1727,"them. If you want to remain different and even alone, you are lost (and it is",UNK
1728,not far from reality) I think it is tragic that the story is real and this,UNK
1729,should be a bell for everybody. No comment for the main actor because he is already,UNK
1730,given an award and I believe that his play was great. Small comment for Hatzisavvas (plays,UNK
1731,"the policeman), he is like a dinosaur, he has played a lot of roles and I'm",UNK
1732,sure that this role for him was very easy but he plays it so great that,UNK
1733,you cannot deny him a big bravo. I definitely recommend this movie to anybody who wants,UNK
1734,to see a good Greek movie.,UNK
1735,"In Iran, women are not admitted to soccer games. Officially it's because they are to be",UNK
1736,spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course it is,UNK
1737,about sexism. Women are lower forms of human beings. Some brave girls oppose this and try,UNK
1738,to get into the stadium by using different tricks. They are caught by soldiers and hold,UNK
1739,"in a kind of cage, until the police will come and pick them up. Despite the",UNK
1740,"insane situation, this is a film with lots of humor. It's also encouraging to see how",UNK
1741,people always find different ways of fighting oppression. You'll get touched at the same time as,UNK
1742,you have lots of laughs. Good job by director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways,UNK
1743,a heroic comedy.,UNK
1744,"*Contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques, so read at your own",UNK
1745,risk!* I loved this film. The use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it,UNK
1746,seem like an old photograph come to life. I also enjoyed the projection of people on,UNK
1747,"a back screen. For instance, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and she is projected",UNK
1748,behind him rather than in a typical split screen. Her face is huge in the back,UNK
1749,and Leo's is in the foreground. One of the best uses of this is when the,UNK
1750,"young boys kill the Ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster",UNK
1751,"style, with facial close ups. It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin, that intense constant style coupled",UNK
1752,with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore. Same with the,UNK
1753,scene when Katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub...you can only see the red water,UNK
1754,"on the side. It is one of the things I love about Von Trier, his understatement",UNK
1755,"of horror, which ends up making it all the more creepy. The use of text in",UNK
1756,"the film was unique, like when Leo's character is pushed by the word, ""Werewolf."" I have",UNK
1757,never seen anything like that in a film. The use of black comedy in this film,UNK
1758,was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as Leo's uncle. It brings up the snickers I,UNK
1759,got from his role in the Kingdom (Riget.) This humor makes the plotline of absurd anal,UNK
1760,"retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of WW2 and all the chaos, easier to",UNK
1761,take. It reminds me of Riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain,UNK
1762,a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy. It shows that,UNK
1763,"some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them. Yet some people, like",UNK
1764,"Leo, are tuned in, but do nothing positive about it. The voice over, done expertly well",UNK
1765,"by Max von Sydow, is amusing too. It draws you into the story and makes you",UNK
1766,"jump into Leo's head, which at times is a scary place to be. The movie brings",UNK
1767,up the point that one is a coward if they don't choose a side. I see,UNK
1768,"the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where Bjork's character doesn't speak up for",UNK
1769,"herself and ends up being her own destruction. Actually, at one time, Von Trier seemed anti-woman",UNK
1770,"to me, by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know his male characters",UNK
1771,"don't fare well either! I found myself at the same place during the end of Dancer,",UNK

1774,"Ghost Train is a fine and entertaining film, typical of the better British comedy chillers of",UNK
1775,the 1930s and 40s. The antics of comedian Arthur Askey are not as funny as they,UNK
1776,"once apparently were, but this can be overcome by viewing him as a period piece or",UNK
1777,"a curiosity. For a low-budget wartime production, Ghost Train is atmospheric, effective, and it provides some",UNK

1790,how to use mind control to have the trapped people slow their breathing by entering a,UNK

1795,"there is so much more to it. This movie shows the very strong, often contradictory personalities",UNK
1796,"of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children, Erik and Sabriye. Erik is an American",UNK
1797,blind mountain climber/athlete and Sabriye is a blind German academic who started a school in Lhasa,UNK
1798,"Tibet. They are both exceptional in their own ways, but disagree on what will really build",UNK
1799,confidence in the kids. Erik wants them to reach the summit while Sabriye wants them to,UNK
1800,enjoy Erik as a role model and take pleasure in moment. The nuances are complicated and,UNK
1801,one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was,UNK
1802,a mistake or a great idea. The most profound scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves,UNK
1803,and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school. The most moving for,UNK
1804,"me was the story of Tashi, a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after",UNK
1805,his parents abandoned him. I could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy,UNK

1840,"The vignettes are good (especially Speed Demon), but the best part of this movie is the",UNK

1843,"cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout! The real gem however is the incredible ""Smooth",UNK
1844,"Criminal"" video, which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone!",UNK
1845,This movie was highly entertaining. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more,UNK
1846,impressive is Brian Adams doing all the songs in French as well. The score is also,UNK
1847,"uplifting and dramatic. The movie is made from a mix of traditional animation, combined with computer",UNK
1848,generated images. The result is truly stunning. I watch this film at least once a week,UNK
1849,with my kids and we never tire of it. The story is compelling and well narrated.,UNK
1850,I don't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7. Definately a keeper,UNK
1851,in my household.,UNK
1852,What if a platoon of G.I.'s from the Japanese army were to be send back in,UNK
1853,time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation,UNK
1854,of the Tokugawa Shogunate? Great pitch right? The movie does exactly what it says on the,UNK
1855,"tin. Thankfully the writers didn't bother to explain the, usually ridiculous in sci-fi movies, scientific mumbo",UNK
1856,jumbo of time transport. No how's or why's. They just did. However the time transport sequence,UNK
1857,"itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful, if not a bit dated. Not as silly",UNK
1858,as one would imagine. The rest of the movie follows the premise to a T. But,UNK
1859,while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the G.I.s arrival,UNK
1860,"to medieval Japan, it picks up with a devastating battle sequence. Undoubtedly it's the main order",UNK
1861,"of the day. The whole concept and by extension the movie itself, was probably originated from",UNK
1862,this simple pitch: what if G.I.'s equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight,UNK
1863,samurais? And boy does it deliver. The main battle sequence that spans more than half an,UNK
1864,hour is probably one of THE best of its kind in 70's action/war movies. Not only,UNK
1865,"is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length, it's also a terrific mish-mash of styles",UNK
1866,"and techniques that only unique premises like G.I. Samurai can deliver. I mean, where else would",UNK
1867,"you get the chance to feature tanks, ninjas complete with shuriikens, a helicopter and samurais in",UNK
1868,"the same shot? The G.I. platoon led by lieutenant Iba tears literally through hundreds of extras,",UNK
1869,"gunning them down with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. This mish-mash of styles is with",UNK
1870,one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai-geki epic of Kurosawa's Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai,UNK
1871,"Banners, while the other is in western action and war movies. There are stylistic touches (like",UNK
1872,the wonderful slow-motion shots and bloody violence) that bring Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari circa,UNK
1873,Keoma to mind. Japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other Hollywood works and,UNK
1874,"vice versa, and G.I. Samurai effortlessly turns this east-meets-west melting pot into an exciting film. The",UNK
1875,film-makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it. Not that,UNK
1876,"tongue-in-cheek mentality is completely absent, it's just that it doesn't try to pander to so-bad-it's-good audiences",UNK
1877,"that enjoy laughing at their movies. The budget was probably hefty, as it is evident in",UNK
1878,"the hundreds of extras, elaborate costumes (very decent for a production that is not a traditional",UNK
1879,"jidai-geki) and special effects. The camera-work and editing are all top notch, almost better than a",UNK
1880,movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves. It's not withouts its flaws either of course. There,UNK
1881,"are many ""song"" scenes, where all sorts of 70's Japanese rock, disco and country songs play",UNK
1882,"over montages (there's a bonding scene, a love-interest scene, a ""war is hell"" scene etc). The",UNK
1883,songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing. Although it clocks,UNK
1884,"at a whooping 140 minutes, it flies like a bullet for the most part. Still some",UNK
1885,"scenes, flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect.",UNK
1886,"The cast also deserves a mention, featuring such prominent names as Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin,",UNK

1916,"This film isn't just about a school shooting, in fact its never even seen. But that",UNK
1917,just adds to the power this film has. Its about people and how they deal with,UNK
1918,tragedy. I know it was shown to the students who survived the Columbine shooting and it,UNK
1919,provided a sense of closure for a lot of them. The acting is superb. All three,UNK
1920,"main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their roles...I highly recommend",UNK
1921,this film to anyone. Its one of those films that makes you talk about it after,UNK
1922,you see it. It provokes discussion of not only school shootings but of human emotions and,UNK
1923,reactions to all forms of tragedy. It is a tear-jerker but it is well worth it,UNK
1924,and one i will watch time and time again,UNK

1926,"One finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor, When tragedy",UNK
1927,strikes and hearts are changed forever. Definitely a film to have a box of tissues with,UNK
1928,you! A powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all,UNK

1930,"and a passionate romance blossoms. Her two jealous ""friends"" play an immature prank which quickly leads",UNK

1933,"Like many Americans, I was first introduced to the works of Hayao Miyazaki when I saw",UNK
1934,"""Spirited Away."" I fell in love with the film and have seen it many times. Now",UNK
1935,I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki. One of his earlier works,UNK
1936,"is ""Castle in the Sky."" Although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as ""Spirited Away""",UNK
1937,(though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair). A young boy,UNK
1938,"named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is working in a mine late one night, when he",UNK
1939,"sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she",UNK
1940,"introduces herself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it,",UNK
1941,"Pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army",UNK
1942,and a lost floating city. Going into a film by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect,UNK
1943,"one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can",UNK
1944,create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki. Watching a film by Miyazaki is like,UNK
1945,"experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood. Because the film is animated, dubbing the film does",UNK
1946,not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or,UNK
1947,not the lip movements match up to the words. It also helps that the translated dialogue,UNK
1948,is well-written and voiced by talented actors. The voice acting is varied. James Van Der Beek,UNK
1949,fares best. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is,UNK
1950,perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta. She's frightened by the,UNK
1951,"events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do. Mark Hamill is",UNK
1952,"unrecognizable as the evil Muska. He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything",UNK
1953,to get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola. Leachman may,UNK
1954,"have won an Oscar for ""The Last Picture Show,"" but she's annoying as the pirate leader.",UNK
1955,Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. It's so bad it nearly,UNK
1956,"ruins the film! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast as the general.",UNK
1957,"I would definitely recommend seeing ""Castle in the Sky."" I'll probably end up buying it myself.",UNK
1958,"But even though it's not as good as ""Spirited Away,"" it's still pretty good.",UNK
1959,I'm not a follower of a certain movie genre. I classify movies only as industrial or,UNK
1960,"non-industrial. Valentine is the second industrial movie of the director Jamie Blanks, after his Urban Legends.",UNK
1961,Unlike Urban Legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak. Yet again unlike Urban,UNK
1962,"Legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic, and that is what",UNK
1963,"makes Valentine the best. As the first basic and iconic element, the growing hatred of the",UNK
1964,"serial killer is so down-to-earth. Since his secondary school years, he has grown up with his",UNK
1965,"wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends, who have made fun of",UNK
1966,"him. When you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie, you will come",UNK
1967,"to see this point of view of Humanism: ""Noone is entirely good or evil. In fact,",UNK
1968,"somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted."" Just because the story line and the",UNK
1969,"direction is very weak, we are not as satisfied as we deserved. The second iconic element",UNK
1970,"is, of course, the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s' super starlets: My favourite is Jessica",UNK
1971,Cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed. An arrow shot from a,UNK
1972,"bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in, while she was playing hide-and-seek with her blind",UNK

1975,"Denise Richards is killed third, while she just found a Valentines' Day gift for her at",UNK
1976,"a whirlpool bath. Jessica Capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way, then she",UNK
1977,is calumniated to be as the serial killer. Marley Shelton is the unluckiest one with a,UNK
1978,vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that,UNK
1979,"we will never know, 'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting",UNK
1980,"killed. Finally, Benita Ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the",UNK
1981,"serial killer, David Boreanaz. The third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the",UNK
1982,"blind date labyrinth scene, the Valentines' Day celebration at Dorothy's house scenes and ultimately the killing",UNK
1983,themes. Everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as I know. Hard Rock never suits better,UNK

1985,"SPOILERS Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon, with a flawless idea, and almost every single",UNK

1988,"Sure, it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first",UNK
1989,"Tom and Jerry episodes, and I can say that I agree, but the fact of the",UNK
1990,"matter is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are great, but some are just better than",UNK
1991,"others. Well, this would fit into ""others."" Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom is",UNK
1992,"listening to an old scary radio broadcast, and becomes easily frightened. Jerry observes how scared he",UNK
1993,"is, and tries to scare him even more than he already is. He creates scary dilemmas",UNK
1994,"for Tom, and Tom becomes scared out of his wits, and his lives. Jerry then puts",UNK

2116,view just before her disappearance doesn't get caught on camera. This is a critical piece of,UNK
2117,the mystery. It's inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and,UNK
2118,not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery. * The movie goes to,UNK
2119,great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children's movements but,UNK
2120,misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have,UNK
2121,entered the crime scene from camera-visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing,UNK
2122,"clues. * In England, driving is on the left. The director goes out of his way",UNK
2123,"to have the car at the crime scene park on the right, several meters away from",UNK
2124,"the flower kiosk, when it could have easily parked immediately behind, or even on the side;",UNK
2125,as the huge truck did. * The police forensics team is so meticulous as to find,UNK
2126,"a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime,",UNK
2127,"but can't find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene, even",UNK
2128,though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall. *,UNK
2129,Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children; this from the country,UNK
2130,that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting. * It is,UNK
2131,illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck,UNK
2132,driver that stopped at the flower kiosk. * It is illogical that the mother would go,UNK
2133,to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails,UNK
2134,for her eventual murder investigators even coaxing her daughter to do the same-- while she simply,UNK
2135,could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home. If she had enough sense about,UNK
2136,"her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails, she could of just",UNK
2137,as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home,UNK
2138,that was in a crowded residential park. * The suspect that abducted the little girl was,UNK
2139,"portrayed as mentally slow/dimwitted --justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother but, he was smart enough",UNK
2140,not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self-incriminate. There,UNK
2141,are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionado's disappointment. 'Five Days',UNK
2142,is a very weak British crime story.,UNK

2168,"rather so-bad-its-funny piece of mediocrity. Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street rumbler, I suppose",UNK

2356,still the dullest movie I've ever seen. It just went on and on with no discernible,UNK

2358,around in confusion. Had the projectionist missed a reel? I've never had the urge to find,UNK

2361,"totally mystified audience afterwords. Fortunately, this was just an exception for Jack, Bruce, and Karen Black.",UNK
2362,The movie has several story lines that follow several different characters. The different story lines don't,UNK
2363,feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets,UNK

2365,way better of watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery channel with Steve and Terri,UNK

2424,something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they,UNK
2425,were posing at an office picnic. And then there are those bullets as a previous commentator,UNK
2426,mentioned. Perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someone's,UNK
2427,pants pocket.,UNK
2428,"When I saw this movie cover, the first thing I thought was that it was made",UNK
2429,for video. The second thing that came to mind was how similar this looked to another,UNK
2430,"terrible movie ""Darkness Falls"", the tale of this dumb witch who killed people in the dark.",UNK
2431,"Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was quite the masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage, and this movie",UNK
2432,should not have been made. The film starts off with a small back story for the,UNK
2433,"witch, or, more like a pointless introduction of two little kids who are going to go",UNK
2434,meet the tooth fairy in hopes of her giving them a shiny new bicycle for their,UNK
2435,"tooth. The opening is filmed poorly, and like the rest of the movie, it's certainly not",UNK
2436,"scary. In present time, the movie is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter's renting out his house,",UNK
2437,"and his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West), and her daughter Cole come to stay there. Cole meets",UNK
2438,"a neighborhood child, and they talk of the Tooth Fairy, and how you shouldn't lose your",UNK
2439,"tooth, or she'll come for you. Unfortunately seconds later, it looks like the Tooth Fairy steals",UNK
2440,her bike and knocks her tooth out (How ironic). Will Cole survive the wrath of the,UNK
2441,"Tooth Fairy, and will her mother and Peter be able to save her, and rekindle their",UNK
2442,"romance...this is a bad movie, you could probably figure it out. One of the main problems",UNK
2443,with this idiotic film is how undefined the Tooth Fairy is. They say she kills you,UNK
2444,"if you lose your tooth, but nope. She's more like a serial killer who kills at",UNK
2445,"random, and if you lose your tooth, you're definitely going to go. She steals a bike,",UNK
2446,so apparently she's a thief too. I said earlier that the idea for this movie was,UNK
2447,"based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get the inspiration for the Tooth Fairy's appearance?",UNK
2448,"Let's see. She looks like a burn victim, and she previously went around the neighborhood slaughtering",UNK
2449,"children. Hmmm...it's almost as though she's an exact rip-off of Freddy Krueger from the ""Nightmare on",UNK
2450,"Elm Street"" films. And this is not the worst part of this awful mess, the climax",UNK
2451,is. This movie might have the most laughable climax (Not literally laughable because I found it,UNK
2452,more sickening than funny) I've ever seen. Don't see this. Just a little trivia. Lochlyn Munroe,UNK
2453,"was in Scary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3, and they both were",UNK
2454,"in this, so apparently Scary Movie stars are forced to end out their career with bad",UNK
2455,scary movies. My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 80 mins. R for violence.,UNK
2456,"Spoilers. First off, nothing really happened in this movie, other than a woman bleeding inexplicably. Second,",UNK
2457,"it wasn't scary. Third, it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever. Let me elaborate.",UNK
2458,"The sound was edited by either Beavis or Butthead  I'm not sure which, so let's",UNK
2459,just go with Beavis. The movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble,UNK
2460,"and mutter, forcing you to turn up the volume (I watched this at home). Then Beavis",UNK
2461,"blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scary/shocking images, forcing you to quickly lower the volume",UNK
2462,"again. This occurs many times until, mercifully, the movie ends. I can picture Beavis laughing vulgarly",UNK
2463,from behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each,UNK
2464,"time. If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep, this",UNK
2465,one is a big mistake. But then it's a big mistake anyway. Here's a thought ,UNK
2466,"if you're going to make a horror movie, at least add a gratuitous beheading, a 19-year-old",UNK
2467,blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off,UNK

2470,"with a maniacal laugh, or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum",UNK
2471,foil (a la TV's Lost in Space). These people didn't even try to scare me. They,UNK
2472,just wanted to hurt my ears.,UNK
2473,"I caught this movie on FX last night, and as I was sitting there watching it,",UNK
2474,"it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever. Bad acting,",UNK
2475,"bad cinematography, bad sound, totally unbelievable fight sequences, stupid characters. All these made it up to",UNK

2479,"The original Thunderbirds earned a place in TV history. It was, and still is, much beloved",UNK

2482,"sequence (if you don't believe me, get the movie, and then get a copy of the",UNK
2483,original episode where Thunderbird 2 is launched). This movie was a crass attempt at making a,UNK

2487,Thunderbirds put their own lives and resources at risk for no reward - the very essence,UNK
2488,of heroism and selflessness. There was little physical violence. The Thunderbirds challenged the imagination to a,UNK
2489,degree - how many of us would dream of someday building a Thunderbird 2? And don't,UNK
2490,underestimate the power of entertainment to do this - many Japanese attribute their fascination with humanoid,UNK
2491,robots to the old Astroboy cartoon. But this movie was a poor re-image of the original.,UNK
2492,"This movie came across as a meld between Thunderbirds and Loony Tunes - I mean, we",UNK
2493,have Anthony Edwards as Brain imitating Porky Pig's stuttering????? Much of the action consists of Kung,UNK
2494,"Fu/Power Rangers type fighting. Indeed, there were funny sound effects when someone got nailed on the",UNK
2495,head with a frying pan. The tech that fired our imagination was absent - instead we,UNK
2496,"have these kids running around, using a plot device that was NEVER in the original series",UNK
2497,"(having the entire team take off at once, leaving the base occupied by the kids and",UNK
2498,"Brain). Then there was a dose of ""Use the Force Luke"" mysticism thrown in when TinTin",UNK
2499,"would levitate something or another, coupled with the The Hood using aerodynamics that looked like they",UNK
2500,"were lifted from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". About the only thing missing was for The Hood",UNK
2501,"to go ""TinTin, I am your Uncle"" with a breath mask voice. The heart that made",UNK
2502,Thunderbirds unique was GONE. The only bright point was Ron Cook's portrayal of Parker - he,UNK
2503,caught it perfectly. But the actress playing Lady Penelope came across as a child - HUH????,UNK
2504,And this is why we hate this movie. When someone puts out something that was popular,UNK
2505,"to a fan base, and expects the fans to shell out money to watch, and then",UNK
2506,"delivers something than wasn't even close to what the fans expect - well, I am sorry,",UNK
2507,"that is just plain WRONG! OK, so if they were making a kids' movie - fine",UNK

2542,1980s. They usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to,UNK

2545,"Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just bad. The plot has",UNK

2547,"to inner city high schools. Which is odd, in that the students at this school are",UNK
2548,"both wealthy and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Makes you wonder",UNK
2549,"how they cannot find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property",UNK

2551,"school alive, if the students can raise $200,000. So the seniors go about doing this. Hmmm,",UNK
2552,"you raise $200,000 but instead of saving that for college, you put it towards saving the",UNK
2553,high school that you are a Senior in? And why exactly would they close an overpopulated,UNK

2577,so familiar it just isn't funny. How many times does the same movie about sports have,UNK
2578,"to be made? Last years we saw this same material in ""Air Bud: Golden Receiver,"" and",UNK

2582,for? Teenagers? Elderly? People who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this?,UNK

2595,goes out. I was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to,UNK

2610,OK but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it,UNK
2611,nicely. The story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just,UNK

2663,makers of this prequel clearly did not watch the original Carlito's Way or at least did,UNK
2664,not care about continuity. This movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already,UNK

2666,at least lead up to it. Not one of Carlito's close old friends from the original,UNK

2668,is in the movie but he plays a completely different character. The original takes place in,UNK

2673,"***Semi Spoiler*** We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito has spent 5 years in",UNK

2837,to impersonate a monkey. The director more than likely committed a murder-suicide with the chimpanzees after,UNK
2838,the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent Warner Bros. film and he,UNK
2839,ended up owing money to the studio. It also doesn't help that he wasn't even infamous,UNK
2840,"for the terrible job he did, he wasn't even known for producing a poop-chute film. Why",UNK
2841,was this movie ever made?,UNK
2842,"It's been a looooonnnggg time since I saw this comedy, and I'd forgotten just how idiotic",UNK
2843,it is. I'd place this easily in the lower two or three of Elvis Presley's very,UNK
2844,"worst movies. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-breed Indian bull rider who returns home to Arizona",UNK
2845,"and the broken-down shack where his family lives, and where his friends love to party all",UNK
2846,"night long. His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old Indian",UNK
2847,"grandpa is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offer anything of substance , comically or otherwise.",UNK
2848,"The government has invested in the family's cattle, but they're lacking a bull. Elvis gets to",UNK
2849,"sing just a few utterly worthless songs, and is pursued by a young boy-crazy gal and",UNK
2850,"her gun-toting mother. This is just a real slapdash of a mess, and the dilapidated surroundings",UNK
2851,"practically stink of manure and don't make this much easier. The one thing that puzzles me,",UNK
2852,"however, is that Elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film. Hard",UNK
2853,"to believe, considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movies.",UNK
2854,"After I watched this movie, I came to IMDb and read some of the reviews, which",UNK
2855,compared it to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that I immediately could see the,UNK
2856,"reviewers point. This movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme. Interestingly, the format of",UNK
2857,"the movie is nearly identical, but the PACING is incredibly different. ""10 Items"" rushes the viewer",UNK
2858,"through the 1-day time line of the movie, whereas the better-planned ""Lost In..."" seems to stretch",UNK
2859,out over a few long days. I'm sure some people will see this because it has,UNK
2860,"Morgan Freeman, and will be disappointed. It seems his better roles now-a-days are supporting roles in",UNK
2861,"big blockbusters, rather than leading roles in sub-$10mil limited release movies and indie films.",UNK
2862,The only reason I watched this film was because I had recently read Robert Hough's less,UNK
2863,"than perfect, but interesting, fictionalised account of the life of Big Cat trainer Mabel Stark. Beaty",UNK
2864,"appears as a character in the book, in a less than flattering light. I hadn't realised",UNK
2865,until checking the movie out later on the IMDb that it was originally a serial. Whoever,UNK
2866,edited the original running time of 233 minutes down to the 68 minuted version available on,UNK
2867,DVD has done a hell of a good job. The shortened version plays just as well,UNK
2868,as any B movie of the period despite the many 'duh-what?' moments. For instance are we,UNK
2869,really expected to believe our hero dug that twenty foot deep tiger trap in a morning,UNK
2870,without even getting his jodhpurs dirty? Looking over the chapter titles I see that number five,UNK
2871,"is titled ""Gorilla Warfare"" and number eleven is called ""The Gorilla"". There were no gorillas at",UNK
2872,all in the movie. I guess that's where some of the cuts were made. Historicaly interesting.,UNK
2873,I got this movie out of Blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get,UNK
2874,like 5 movies for 20 bucks. I'd have to say I got my money's worth on,UNK
2875,"this one. I had expected horrible dialogue, crappy monsters, and shaky cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said,",UNK
2876,"two outta three ain't bad. The acting is bad, though not as bad as some movies",UNK
2877,I've seen. Or maybe I've watched so many low budget movies recently I've lost perspective. There,UNK
2878,"are some bits were the acting is downright terrible, but for the most part it's of",UNK
2879,at least High School Play level. The CG for the Sasquatch in this movie is probably,UNK
2880,the second-worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed another,UNK
2881,reviewer agreed with me) was that a man in an ape suit would have been better.,UNK
2882,Clunky stop-motion animation would have looked better. So you may be asking why I call the,UNK
2883,CG the second-worst part. That's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound,UNK
2884,"effects. They are loud, annoying, and constant. I've been camping, I know what insects sound like",UNK
2885,"in the woods at night, and while they can be loud, they're not deafening like the",UNK
2886,"cacophony in this movie. Usually when the ""background"" sounds drown out the movie's dialogue, it's a",UNK
2887,"bad thing, but from what I caught of the dialogue of this film, I wasn't missing",UNK
2888,"much. The action was infrequent and boring. The tension was non-existent, as was any sense of",UNK
2889,"empathy with the characters. Speaking of the characters, they were all cookie-cutter and bland. The only",UNK
2890,"mildly engaging byplay was between...actually, I can't think of anything. There was a line or two",UNK
2891,"that made me crack a wan smile, but that was about it. The cinematography was decent,",UNK
2892,"a step or two above what you'd normally see in a movie like this. However, it",UNK
2893,"still had that ""home movie"" quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket",UNK
2894,change and a prayer. If you're like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget,UNK
2895,"genre flicks, and you see this one in the dollar bin, think about grabbing it. Otherwise,",UNK
2896,stay away at all costs.,UNK
2897,Has to be one of the worst wastes of 35mm movie film ever unleashed on the,UNK
2898,"public, the sequel to the at least entertaining pseudo-documentary original film ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"".",UNK
2899,"Bad script, worse acting, etc., etc., Dawn Wells had to be hoping that Gilligan would come",UNK
2900,rescue her and take her back to the island just to escape from this piece of,UNK
2901,clap-trap.,UNK
2902,"When I rented this movie, I had very low expectations......but when I saw it, I realized",UNK
2903,that the movie was less (a lot less) than what I expected. The actors were bad,UNK
2904,"(the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid...it could work for",UNK
2905,"a Disney movie (except for the murders), but this one is not a comedy, it is",UNK
2906,a laughable masterpiece of stupidity. The title is well chosen except for one thing: they could,UNK
2907,add stupid movie after Dead Husbands! I give it 0 and a half out of 5.,UNK
2908,Even if one didn't realize that Sellers was in poor health at the time of filming,UNK
2909,"and passed away before the film's release, THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU would be",UNK
2910,painful viewing. It is supposedly a lampoon of Sax Rohmer's famous Oriental villain but it lacks,UNK
2911,any focus. The potential for satirical commentary on the anti-Oriental overtones of Rohmer's concept are ignored.,UNK
2912,"Indeed, the movie employs racist insults. There are hardly any actual jokes or gags, just mostly",UNK
2913,actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines. It is especially distressing to see Sid Caesar forced,UNK
2914,to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs. Most of the other actors embarrass themselves,UNK
2915,as well. And then there's Peter Sellers. He plays the dual roles of the sinister Fu,UNK
2916,"Manchu, who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart British",UNK
2917,foe Nayland Smith. Sellers isn't one hundred per cent bad; he conveys a quirky warmth as,UNK
2918,Smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he's oddly moving as,UNK
2919,"Manchu when he expresses his love for English music hall entertainment. But most of the time,",UNK
2920,"he plays both roles with a weary grimness, thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities. Sellers' routines",UNK
2921,where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating; he seems too convincingly,UNK
2922,"agonized to be funny. A few genuinely witty lines, an apt slapstick bit by Burt Kwouk",UNK
2923,"(Cato in the PINK PANTHER films) as one of Manchu's minions, and Helen Mirren's amusing musical",UNK
2924,numbers cannot salvage this mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a,UNK
2925,"comedic genius, they won't learn anything from THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.",UNK
2926,This movie had what sounded like a good premise: 9 people facing their fears to win,UNK
2927,"one million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. There are",UNK
2928,several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene. A few,UNK
2929,scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts. The acting is,UNK
2930,"bad, but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness. What's really strange is that",UNK
2931,"towards the end of the movie it turns into like a 5 minute western, and at",UNK
2932,"the end, the twists, of which their were several, don't make sense with the rest of",UNK
2933,the movie. It seemed as though the director just added stuff on because he thought it,UNK
2934,"would look cool, while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point. It",UNK
2935,just didn't make a lot of sense. The only creepy thing was the old people dancing,UNK
2936,"down the hall, but that doesn't even come close to making up for the rest of",UNK
2937,this mess.,UNK
2938,"If you read my review of SyFy's ""Dinoshark"", you know that I can appreciate the low-budget",UNK

2940,"""so bad, it's good"" kind of way. So, still smacking with guilt for liking (and recommending)",UNK
2941,"the undeniably hokey ""Dinoshark"", I sat down to watch ""Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy"", a SyFy Original Movie",UNK

2944,"could it possibly go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it actually misses the mark...not by much,",UNK

2946,"the dreaded hammerhead-human hybrid, takes a backseat to a bunch of faux-military thugs who really become",UNK

2948,or whatever you call the thing) only arrives just before someone is going to be munched,UNK

2965,failed to flow with any rhyme or reason. the majority of the lines by the characters,UNK

2981,...let me count the ways. 1. A title-only 'remake' that pulls out every cliché in the,UNK
2982,slasher handbook. 2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. 3. A completely weak,UNK
2983,"execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills. 4. A PG-13 rating that insures no gore,",UNK

3002,I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. In their long,UNK
3003,list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an,UNK
3004,"offensive title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the film was",UNK
3005,"only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it had turned",UNK
3006,"out to be some porno movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to",UNK
3007,"be the most bizarre film I have ever seen. The Danish production crew tried, with a",UNK
3008,"budget of about $49, to make a Star Trek-style film about a crew of very gay",UNK
3009,men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women--like they proceeded,UNK
3010,"to do on the Earth! And in every case, they were met with cheers and thanks",UNK
3011,"from the now gay men of the planet. Subtle, this ain't. With some of the most",UNK
3012,"obscene and juvenile names of characters I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write",UNK
3013,"them on IMDb without having my review removed! However, despite the utter crappiness of it all,",UNK
3014,"it was strangely watchable and worth a peek. But, as I mentioned already, due to the",UNK
3015,"crude names and odd subject matter (though no nudity), it's a film for adults only. By",UNK
3016,"the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this, WHY",UNK
3017,make it and WHO was the intended audience?! It may not be the absolute worst thing,UNK
3018,"I have ever seen, but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive!",UNK
3019,"Mind, my friends and I saw the movie based off it's title alone. It's cute, though",UNK
3020,obvious in it's plot and direction-- you know where the movie is going within the first,UNK
3021,"five minutes. My main contention with the plot is that while it remains tolerably consistent, they",UNK
3022,"never explain a lot of the things behind the characters. An alcoholic father, overworked mother, stressed-out",UNK
3023,"sister... that's a bad family, but aside from the occasional mention from the sister, there's not",UNK
3024,any resolution. I was also confused as to the scene with the bottles... it seemed pretty,UNK
3025,"random. The writing is a secondary concern... the kids weren't bad actors, but their script left",UNK
3026,"a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a cute niche movie was pushed",UNK
3027,"aside for a single, blah special effect, lame scripting, and a glaringly obvious plot.",UNK
3028,Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of those guys from the past that seems,UNK
3029,pretty forgettable. I never thought that his show was all that great. This is his one,UNK
3030,"dimensional characterization of a crime boss, with very predictable results. If you take the car chases",UNK
3031,"and the general rambling out, there isn't much plot development or action. I find mafia movies",UNK
3032,to be dull because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions.,UNK
3033,"Hollywood, and in this case, the Italian cinema, treat these guys as heroes. I saw the",UNK
3034,"film and in a few days I won't remember much about it. Lots of shooting, innocent",UNK
3035,"bystanders dying, betrayal, and that sick loyalty. The film is photographed pretty well and the acting",UNK
3036,is decent. But the dubbing is so bad (due to voices that just couldn't come out,UNK
3037,"of those bodies), that I almost started looking for Godzilla approaching the bay.",UNK
3038,My comment is for the Russian version of Space Race named Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for,UNK
3039,"Space) shown on Russia's First Channel on April 10-13, 2006. Bad translation could have ruined some",UNK
3040,details but I doubt it's the case. The number of factual errors is such that it's,UNK
3041,"impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of first missiles). Even the",UNK
3042,U.S. half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions. The audience is not told of,UNK
3043,any V-2/A-4 launches from the U.S. Three different Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same,UNK
3044,"serial number 'UE' onboard. Apollo 1 is to be launched to the Moon, etc. In the",UNK
3045,"Russian half, each and every person is ludicrous. Korolev is scared of NKVD, Glushko is saboteur",UNK
3046,"and traitor, Mishin is alcoholic etc. Men as functions; no motivation, no life at all. Uniform",UNK
3047,and decorations are awful. Gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch (I think this was added,UNK
3048,specially for Russian version).,UNK
3049,First off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by,UNK
3050,saying that I hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as,UNK
3051,being so stupid that you wounder if they're all the result of inbreeding. Now I will,UNK
3052,say this I did see the first three American Pie movies and while they weren't the,UNK
3053,most amazing movies that I'd ever seen they were all right (and outright masterpieces compared to,UNK
3054,"the three ""American Pie Presents"" films), I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were",UNK
3055,they thinking when they made this movie? I also have a few other questions too. Who,UNK
3056,thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? who approved the,UNK
3057,final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)? And lastly why did,UNK
3058,anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission,UNK
3059,is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone,UNK
3060,straight to the discount bin at Blockbuster or Wal Mart? There is so much wrong with,UNK
3061,this movie that I can't write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed,UNK
3062,the maximum allowed words on this forum so I'll just touch on the biggest things wrong,UNK
3063,with it. The plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting,UNK
3064,as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that I can see wrong,UNK
3065,with this movie is the acting. While most of the cast are talentless no namers who,UNK
3066,"will probably be forgotten in a few years, the one and only big name in this",UNK
3067,movie is Eugene Levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with,UNK
3068,"this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer ""I know this isn't funny",UNK
3069,"and I'm wasting my talents but hey I'm getting payed for it so who cares"" he",UNK
3070,doesn't even try to make any of his jokes funny (he really deserves better than this,UNK
3071,garbage). As I mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though,UNK
3072,"some of them have been in some really great TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic",UNK
3073,Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating,UNK
3074,(there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseases)that you almost wish he'd die,UNK
3075,"a slow and painful death on screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just hangs around",UNK
3076,on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film. Maybe the,UNK
3077,next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line,UNK
3078,so they can get around the MPAA and get an R rating this movie goes all,UNK
3079,out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the,UNK
3080,X rating (the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this,UNK
3081,film for its rating). It's interesting that twenty five years ago when Wes Craven submitted A,UNK
3082,Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA for a rating review they forced him to cut,UNK
3083,twenty five seconds of footage (I believe that it was part of a death scene that,UNK
3084,had a silicone casting of a breast in it) to avoid getting an X rating and,UNK
3085,"he had no other choice but to do it or the film wouldn't have been released,",UNK
3086,but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the R rating today because it's all,UNK
3087,"done in the name of comedy, if this movie was a drama or horror film with",UNK
3088,this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it,UNK
3089,"would havegotten the dreaded X rating. The last thing that really annoys me is the writing,",UNK
3090,this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old,UNK
3091,"kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass, nearly every expository",UNK
3092,situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is,UNK
3093,so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the,UNK
3094,"so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes, never mind the often repulsive sexual",UNK
3095,references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written,UNK
3096,by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class. the,UNK
3097,long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any,UNK
3098,"stupider more crass and offensive, this pie is filled with road apples.",UNK

3224,"over, it fades to black, even though sound can still be heard. So this can probably",UNK
3225,be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork makes no sense either as it has what,UNK

3251,slumming when she took this role. This movie is bad for one reason in particular: lapses,UNK

3253,its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008,UNK
3254,it just looks real stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen and I've seen,UNK

3256,a mall an is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop,UNK
3257,that came to her aid. From then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through,UNK
3258,an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full,UNK
3259,of tools. So many things are wrong with this movie. As I said this movie leaps,UNK
3260,"over logic at every turn and with the exception of Kim Basinger, the acting is made-for-TV",UNK
3261,"bad. Hell, this pseudo thriller is made-for-TV bad. The way she kills each of these politically",UNK
3262,"correct thugs(1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African American all coming together to stalk",UNK
3263,a Caucasian woman. Don't you just love America?)is laughable to a fault. The way she killed,UNK
3264,the Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main hoodlum was so,UNK
3265,out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame. I only recommend,UNK
3266,this to lovers of bad films and no one else. Anybody else especially Kim Basinger fans,UNK
3267,would do well not to own this flick. You don't want see an actress you respect,UNK
3268,in a film this bad now do you? Of course not. You were warned.,UNK
3269,Let me be clear. I've used IMDb for years. But only today I went through the,UNK
3270,"trouble of registering on the site, just so I could give this movie the lowest possible",UNK
3271,"rating. I've seen hundreds of films, some of them bad, a few awful. Never, though, have",UNK
3272,"i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence, of high intentions and failure. Mira Sorvino",UNK
3273,"is horribly cast as the princess, but entirely unbelievable as Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw",UNK
3274,"is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even, than",UNK
3275,"in the insipid French play that is the source (Marivaux never reached Hollywood until now, and",UNK
3276,"we should keep it that way). To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate",UNK
3277,"philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker, shouting out names",UNK
3278,of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is played even sillier. For,UNK
3279,"this, the pair should receive a joint 'Clair Danes' award, which in a just world would",UNK
3280,be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired re-interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of,UNK
3281,"the 1990's (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). Aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue, there",UNK
3282,"are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming. For example, there are moments when",UNK
3283,"a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action, sitting in",UNK
3284,"chairs, watching the principal characters. The Director wants us to realize she's adapted a play. I",UNK
3285,"get it. But it doesn't happen at all until far into the film. At that point,",UNK
3286,"seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is creepy and",UNK
3287,"distracting. They're like some sort of un-scary zombie crowd, appearing through the mists, filling us with",UNK
3288,"dread. When you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie, you'll want to",UNK
3289,rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustise of poisoning,UNK
3290,your mind for 112 minutes. -Matthew McGuire,UNK

3301,"made a cameo in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that",UNK

3352,"charges that he was an accomplice, but soon escapes. Upon escaping, the seemingly innocent man kidnaps",UNK
3353,three victims and soon he ropes his girlfriend in on the plot. If this isn't bad,UNK
3354,"enough, the situation quickly makes a downward spiral. This film had some good aspects and many",UNK
3355,bad ones. Its strongest aspect was lead actress Emily Haack. Setting aside the fact she's nude,UNK
3356,"in a fair amount of this film, she presents herself as a decent actress and a",UNK
3357,very strong character. I see no reason she cannot take this experience and somehow turn it,UNK
3358,"into a career in some way. I was convinced she was a ruthless individual. Also, the",UNK
3359,makers of this film were very bold and pulled no punches. Graphic nudity (both male and,UNK
3360,"female), coprophagia, and extreme anal violence are not shied away from. I like my horror films",UNK
3361,"to push the boundaries a little bit, and this one ignored them altogether, gladly skipping towards",UNK
3362,"Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think they achieved what they were looking for.",UNK
3363,"But now the negative aspects. First, and most noticeable, this film is very low budget and",UNK
3364,"the film quality shows this. I can excuse that -- the plot was decent, the acting",UNK
3365,fine and in some scenes the lower quality film actually made the movie more disturbing (a,UNK
3366,"more realistic feel). So, I won't scold them for having low-grade equipment. What I will scold",UNK
3367,them for is the use of poor choices in shots. For no reason I can ascertain,UNK
3368,"(besides plumping the movie), there is a large amount of footage of a cemetery. I don't",UNK
3369,"really know why, and I frankly started dozing off at this point because it was so",UNK
3370,long and pointless. I also take issue with the title. The idea here was to deceive,UNK
3371,"people into thinking this film had some connection to the classic ""I Spit on Your Grave"".",UNK
3372,"Now, there is a line that seems to imply the main character is the daughter of",UNK
3373,the woman from this other film. And the themes are very loosely the same (a woman,UNK
3374,getting revenge on men). But there is no firm connection and the reason this title was,UNK
3375,chosen was for the video store customer to think they were getting a sequel. This was,UNK
3376,deceptive and dishonest. My last major complaint is that this plot makes no real sense. Not,UNK
3377,even a little bit. A woman is killed in the beginning for no reason. A prison,UNK
3378,"escapee finds time to kidnap people to torture them, for no reason (because they wronged his",UNK
3379,"girlfriend?). The same man goes from good to very evil without explanation. Likewise, the female lead",UNK
3380,"(Haack) turns fro ma normal person to someone who is overly cruel and sadistic, for no",UNK
3381,"reason at all, and against people who for the most part were only marginally mean to",UNK

3391,place???...somebody MUST have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made. I've seen,UNK
3392,better films come out of film schools and I have been to film school so I,UNK
3393,can say that as a fact. The quality of this work is also just SO VERY,UNK
3394,bad to view...shot on DV??? Nuff said. The songs are not songs but just banter that,UNK
3395,sounds the same in every section. Want to see a good musical? THEN DON'T RENT THIS,UNK
3396,MOVIE.,UNK
3397,I am guessing the reason this movie did so well at the box office is of,UNK
3398,"course Eddie Murphy. I think this was his first movie since ""Beverly Hills Cop"" so at",UNK
3399,the time he was hot. Considering that one made over two hundred million and it was,UNK
3400,R and this one made about 80 million and it was pg does say it was,UNK
3401,"not all that popular. I have never been a big Eddie Murphy fan, so that is",UNK
3402,probably another reason I didn't care for it much at all. This one has Eddie as,UNK
3403,some sort of finder of lost kids. He must find the golden child or the world,UNK
3404,"is in terrible peril. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is it",UNK
3405,does not compare to the special effects. I had seen better stuff done in the 70's,UNK
3406,"than some of the stuff this one offers, Ray Harryhausen did better stuff. Still the main",UNK
3407,"reason you see a movie like this is because of Eddie, unfortunately he is not very",UNK
3408,funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the,UNK
3409,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" type scenes. I guess they were hoping for a fish out",UNK
3410,"of water effect, but to me it just did not work.",UNK
3411,"Hey, If your going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen try making it about Leonard",UNK
3412,Cohen! This is filled with only enough Leonard to anger the viewer who will be left,UNK
3413,wondering why they are listening to all these other singers (some of them questionable) talk about,UNK
3414,"themselves. Puleeze....sounds like them reliving their diary entries in junior high - who cares about you,",UNK
3415,"what about Leonard? Guess what people, if you ""do something"" worthy maybe someone will make a",UNK
3416,documentary about you. I found particularly insulting the parading of U2's members as if that would,UNK
3417,add credibility to this movie - NOT. Leonard doesn't need Bono or the Edge talking about,UNK
3418,his spirituality. What would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some,UNK
3419,"piece of his spirituality through the film. Gee, what a concept! I will give props to",UNK
3420,Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their covers of Cohen tunes - the rest of the,UNK
3421,"performances were a bore and some were unbearable. Cohen fans, don't say I didn't warn you!",UNK
3422,The film portrays France's unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in Western (Francophone) Africa through the,UNK
3423,"befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman, France (herein symbolically representing her nation). It",UNK
3424,is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to come to terms,UNK
3425,"with a traumatic moment in her past, in particular, and a nation's desire to reach out",UNK
3426,to the 'other' it once 'owned' and moulded. This is reflected in the way in which,UNK
3427,it centres entirely around the notion of travelling (or being in transit) from the present to,UNK
3428,the past; remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualities. The characters all play a,UNK
3429,"symbolic, albeit a limited and unconvincing role. France, meant to be a visual as well as",UNK
3430,"a totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems",UNK
3431,still to be imbued with the same naiveté she enjoyed as a child-in fact as a,UNK
3432,child she seems more in possession of her reality. The rest of the rag-tag ensemble is,UNK
3433,"just forgettable. The black Africans are, to say the least, offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised",UNK
3434,peoples now colonised by the director's poor handling of her material. They are no more than,UNK
3435,a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythe-like France wonders seeking a world she never,UNK
3436,"knew, and hoping for one that can never be found in Cameroon.",UNK
3437,It's one of those dramas that's so bad that it almost hits the point of being,UNK
3438,"very funny, the script is absolutely dire, direction appalling, lighting purely armature, the only thing letting",UNK
3439,it down from a true so bad it's good feel is that the sound design is,UNK
3440,"only quite bad; it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard, but doesn't at",UNK
3441,least destroy any speeches. There's continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout. And finally,UNK
3442,last but not least the acting is appalling. For a professional production it very much has,UNK
3443,the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for,UNK
3444,anyone who had to put their names to this.,UNK
3445,When I saw this at a shop I thought it looked really good and original. Like,UNK
3446,"Wolfs Creek meets Texas chainsaw massacre, and I mean it only cost three quid (around $6).",UNK
3447,To be honest I don't think it was even worth that. It seemed like the directors-,UNK
3448,the 'butcher brothers' couldn't decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a,UNK
3449,gory slasher horror. It ended up with a cliché ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes,UNK
3450,with all the characters being one dimensional and you couldn't care less what happened to them,UNK
3451,but to try to make the audience care about the characters they added a useless monologue,UNK
3452,at the end and the beginning of the film which to be perfectly honest wasn't needed.,UNK
3453,The only good part really was the middle/end- I won't ruin it for you. But that,UNK
3454,"was the only ""good ""part. Overall a pointless watch. It felt like a two hour film",UNK
3455,but was in fact only 75 minutes. If you want an artsy film-don't bother. If you,UNK
3456,want a slasher movie- don't bother- The film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening.,UNK
3457,"Having seen ""Triumph of the Will,"" I can only say this movie is ghastly, even measured",UNK
3458,"against the historically low ""standards"" of the time. Naturally it's all totally fabricated and prejudicial. This",UNK
3459,"is what one would expect of 1930's German propaganda. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation, itself,",UNK
3460,is hackneyed and cheap. It's also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary Germans must've left the,UNK
3461,"theater holding their noses. In a genre renowned for its base appeal, lack of originality and",UNK
3462,"unapologetic wrong-headedness, this film doesn't even qualify as ""bad."" It would have to improve significantly to",UNK
3463,attain that status!,UNK
3464,Sky Captain is possibly the best awful movie I've seen in a long while. Rife with,UNK
3465,"amazing CG and special effects, studded with an A-list cast (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie",UNK
3466,"and the infinitely likable Giovanni Ribisi) and racing along with an overused but Indiana Jones-esquire storyline,",UNK
3467,"this should have been a great movie to watch. 'Should have' being the key term here,",UNK
3468,of course. Jude Law plays Joe the Sky Captain with a dashing accent and plenty of,UNK
3469,"over-the-shoulder, heart-melting smirks, but you can't make something out of nothing, and even his flippant deliveries",UNK
3470,and boyish good looks can't save the movie's stone dialogue. (If he had slapped Giovanni Ribisi,UNK
3471,"on the back and said, ""Good boy, Dex,"" just ONE more time, I might have barfed",UNK
3472,"all over the guy in front of me.) Gwyneth Paltrow, as Polly Perkins, is nothing less",UNK
3473,than nerve grating. Her nasal whining and not-quite-sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes,UNK
3474,of the movie. Perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30's comic book,UNK
3475,heroine- who knows? I expected more from her. An example of how a similar character was,UNK
3476,"played (and played well) is in the late 90's flick ""The Phantom,"" starring Kristy Swanson and",UNK
3477,Billy Zane. Rent the movie and you'll know what I mean. Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie,UNK
3478,were the saving graces in the film. (Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch. I'll,UNK
3479,"admit it.) In just a few short scenes, both actors somehow managed to rise above the",UNK
3480,"tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry, two-dimensional castmates. The plot and",UNK
3481,"steady story progression were old, boring, and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene",UNK
3482,from an action movie in the past thirty years. The pace is rapid-fire in the first,UNK
3483,"half of the movie, and a snail's pace in the second, giving the audience enough time",UNK
3484,"not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film, but to figure out who the",UNK
3485,"key villain is as well. The pairing is rather clichéd, also- Polly Perkins and Sky Captain",UNK
3486,"apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly-ended romance, and their story isn't so",UNK
3487,much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched. When they finally come to terms,UNK
3488,"with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film, nobody's surprised, and nobody really cares",UNK
3489,either. Props to the director for appreciating Bai Ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl,UNK
3490,"for the entirety of the film, and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as",UNK
3491,"coloration throughout. But Sky Captain, despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie,",UNK
3492,falls flat on its face. Not even worth the $2.75 I paid to get into the,UNK
3493,theater.,UNK
3494,"Gritty, dusty western from director Richard Brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping",UNK
3495,"all the usual clichés intact. Early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (Gene Hackman), a",UNK
3496,"suave gambler (James Coburn), a cocky kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly",UNK
3497,game Candice Bergen). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over,UNK
3498,"whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, though one",UNK
3499,"which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from Gary Cooper's era). Good-looking, if overlong",UNK
3500,"piece has macho verve and a fine cast, yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome",UNK
3501,rather quickly. ** from ****,UNK
3502,"Being a fan of the manga and anime of Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE",UNK
3503,"JACK, etc.), I was looking forward to this one. I'd seen neither the manga nor the",UNK
3504,"anime, so I had no preconceived notions going in. Good thing, too. What we have here",UNK
3505,is a series of silly softcore movies of the type that used to turn up with,UNK
3506,alarming regularity on cable channels late at night. While it's tame compared to what gets rammed,UNK
3507,down the throats of regular cable viewers (our hero's naughty bits are either tastefully tucked away,UNK
3508,"behind a strategically glued-on scarf or emblazoned with a ridiculous sunburst effect), there are prolonged scenes",UNK
3509,of bondage and torture that lend the proceedings just enough smarminess to make it unsuitable for,UNK
3510,"the kiddies. While I have nothing whatsoever against nude female heroes, I do dislike amateurishly made",UNK
3511,"movies (there are at least four in this series). On the plus side, there's at least",UNK
3512,one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I saw. It's no wonder Nagai's,UNK
3513,TESTICLE BOY never made it...,UNK
3514,How did this become a blockbuster? Dear God I don't know where to start why this,UNK
3515,movie sucked too much. The movie was predictable & there was no originality. The only thing,UNK
3516,"I can admire is the acting of some characters. The movie was too bright, they should",UNK
3517,"have done something with the lighting, eg. making the environment more darker. The make up on",UNK
3518,certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick. This is 2006! People,UNK
3519,don't get scared by other people wearing heavy make up. Most of the horror scenes we're,UNK
3520,taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies. Total rip off! This is why I don't,UNK
3521,"watch tagalog movies. The only reason why so many people ""screamed"" while watching this movie is",UNK
3522,because of conformity. How many times do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and,UNK
3523,"improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the TV, its now coming from",UNK
3524,"the window next door? No matter how you put it, ITS STILL A RIP OFF. If",UNK

3527,"I was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find, so when",UNK
3528,"I stumbled upon it on Ebay I forked over the $10 and bought it, now I",UNK
3529,"understand why its so rare! This film is SO bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low",UNK
3530,"budget that the ending credits, which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their",UNK

3533,from another dimension into this reality. When she pulls in some kind of box like object,UNK

3536,"pops out, instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face, then escapes to a",UNK
3537,nearby city. But rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it,UNK
3538,and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to Pettyjohn and Ray to,UNK
3539,"find it on their own, but no matter, this movie blows all its credibility LONG before",UNK

3542,"already! 2 out 10, really, REALLY bad!",UNK
3543,The Lives of the Saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of London as a bustling,UNK
3544,"city of busy, quaint streets and sunshine. I was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere, but",UNK
3545,"it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere. Othello works for big,",UNK
3546,"fat Mr. Karva, his crime-boss step-dad (at least I think that is what he is supposed",UNK
3547,"to be because it's never really defined, but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers,",UNK
3548,"so trust me, he's a prick) doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy",UNK

3552,"he promptly starts granting more wishes. Keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled, Karva",UNK
3553,has the boy kidnapped. But he isn't sure of what would really bring him happiness. Is,UNK
3554,"it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand-job? Either way, I",UNK
3555,don't want to see the little boy grant him the second. It just takes ages to,UNK
3556,get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes. The ending tries to be shocking but,UNK
3557,since there's hardly any back-story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as,UNK
3558,"a release for the bored audience. Writer Tony Grisoni, a favourite of Terry Gilliam, tries to",UNK
3559,"blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell, ironically.",UNK
3560,If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters,UNK
3561,"suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film. As it is,",UNK
3562,we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence,UNK
3563,when confronted by the mysterious boy. Who's origins are never revealed. That's just plain irritating! Aside,UNK
3564,"from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score, this film has little to recommend.",UNK
3565,"I can appreciate what Barney is trying to achieve, but after sitting through this last night",UNK
3566,"at a college movie house, I couldn't help but think...when is this gonna end? A very",UNK
3567,long and ponderous two hours and fifteen minutes. I had only seen a part of Cremaster,UNK
3568,"3 on DVD and thought I knew what to expect. That said, experimental films such as",UNK
3569,this are better digested in small increments. There are a couple of beautiful/horrible images...including the title,UNK
3570,"sequence (no kidding), but if you go into this expecting any kind of plot or meaning,",UNK
3571,"then you are in for a long, snooze-inducing ride. I managed to stay awake for the",UNK
3572,"whole thing (if that's a compliment) but more often than not, I was waiting for some",UNK
3573,kind of meaning or narrative...big mistake. Among the collection of images are a very ornate gift-wrapping,UNK
3574,"ceremony, the creation of a disgusting dish of what appears to be petroleum jelly slabs formed",UNK
3575,with a cookie cutter and sprinkled with shrimp (this is served to the crew of the,UNK
3576,"ship which is shown throughout the film), a large blubber cheesecake with a large tentacle turd",UNK
3577,"placed in the center of it, and the mutual evisceration of Bjork and director Matthew Barney",UNK
3578,"which eventually culminates in some bizarre kind of communion, followed by their transformation into whale-like creatures.",UNK
3579,"The soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying...sometimes even maddening. At one time, there is a",UNK
3580,"song being sung by Bjork to go along with the ephemeral rituals being played before us,",UNK
3581,"and at other times there is just a constant droning of a high-pitched instrument, which we",UNK
3582,see a mysterious woman playing at the beginning and end of the movie. If this sounds,UNK
3583,"like it doesn't make sense, that is because is DOESN'T! If this sounds like your cup",UNK
3584,"of tea, then you will absolutely LOVE it! If this sounds like something that you probably",UNK
3585,"won't like, then stay far away from it, because you will most likely walk out of",UNK
3586,the theater during the halfway mark like several people at the screening I attended. This is,UNK
3587,the very definition of an art film. You get from it what you take from it.,UNK
3588,"But otherwise, there really isn't much there, other than a few oddities and constant construction and",UNK
3589,"deconstruction rituals. I'm glad that there is a place for films such as this, but I",UNK
3590,"can't say I would want to sit through it again. However, I can't say I wouldn't",UNK
3591,want to see one of Barney Cremaster films from start to finish and compare it with,UNK
3592,"this. I think, perhaps now that I know what to expect I might enjoy something like",UNK
3593,"this more. To give you an idea of what kind of comprehension factor this film has,",UNK
3594,"I probably would've liked it better if I had gotten stoned. Then again, it could've felt",UNK
3595,"twice as long as it was, and then it would've REALLY gotten ponderous. Definitely not for",UNK
3596,everyone.,UNK
3597,"I appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of 'horror' movies, but they should",UNK
3598,at least hire some proper actors. The sergeant especially is guilty of using his monotone to,UNK
3599,"bulldozer every single line he has. But let's face it, the lines aren't really important. There",UNK
3600,"isn't really a recognisable plot, so most of the writing involves the words f**k, s**t, m*****f****r",UNK
3601,"and other assorted bad language in place of proper dialogue. The 'story' as it is, is",UNK
3602,"mostly made up of seemingly random gore and death, with a couple of cringe-worthy 'surprises', which",UNK
3603,"happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly what's going to happen. Not only this, but",UNK
3604,there are several glaring plot holes and continuity errors (Why are they going in there? Didn't,UNK
3605,"he have a weapon? Wasn't he dead?), so it makes the whole film seem as if",UNK
3606,it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix them. Another,UNK
3607,film which simply relies on blood and gore instead of any real cinematic experience.,UNK
3608,There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn't help,UNK
3609,with the major downsides to the movie. I never understand why directors ask actors/actresses to use,UNK
3610,accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can't convince. Fiennes just can't,UNK
3611,do Irish and Fitzgerald isn't much better at Russian. When the voice is wrong then no,UNK
3612,matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing. As the for the major,UNK
3613,problem....the plot....was there one? I guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was,UNK
3614,so full of holes that I just couldn't wait for the film to end...it was ridiculous.,UNK
3615,Save 90 minutes of your life and don't watch this movie!,UNK
3616,"There is good. There is bad. And then their is The Sentinel, a bottom-barrel political ""thriller""",UNK

3619,"been so utterly butchered. Directed with ham-handed ""edginess"" by Clark Johnson, every actor in this film",UNK
3620,seems to be working on autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can,UNK
3621,"honestly say I have NEVER, in all my life, viewed another film with so many glaring",UNK
3622,"plot holes. The twist is predictable from square one, and the character's motives are so utterly",UNK
3623,ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience. Avoid this at all costs. This is a,UNK
3624,catastrophe of a movie with no redeeming value.,UNK

3628,"stress the word ""little"" since this is a very low budget flick, and there in lies",UNK
3629,its main weakness. The story takes place in the future. A world in which the great,UNK
3630,superpowers (that according to this movie are the United States and Russia) duke out their differences,UNK
3631,not by going on a full blown world war...but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic,UNK
3632,robots. Our hero Achilles must go up against the evil Russian robot fighter called Alexander. Lots,UNK
3633,"of cheap stop motion animation ensues. Well, the idea is awesome I guess. The great nations",UNK
3634,settleling territorial disputes with giant robots? Interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly,UNK
3635,if the proper budget had been available. Unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends,UNK
3636,"up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director. I as a kid loved this movie,",UNK
3637,"and I guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie, you'll have to revert",UNK
3638,back to little kid mode to have some fun with it. I showed this film to,UNK

3641,"one of my favorite directors Stuart Gordon?"" But as the movie progressed into corny territory I",UNK
3642,almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture. I could go,UNK
3643,"through it, cause I loved this film as a kid, and there's still a little nostalgia",UNK
3644,attached to watching it. But everyone else was just not going to get it. And I,UNK
3645,myself realized that the movie isn't really that good. First off. The movie is about giant,UNK
3646,robots kicking the hell out of each other. And in order to achieve this in a,UNK
3647,"credible fashion you'd have to use some damn good special effects to make it work, expensive",UNK
3648,effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief. But unfortunately this being a small scale,UNK
3649,"movie, from a small scale company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making this film!)the effects",UNK
3650,only help us giggle and laugh at them. Heck even the sets and some of the,UNK
3651,"wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed. OK granted, once you accept that you are watching a",UNK
3652,mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the,UNK
3653,film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other. There are,UNK
3654,"certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool, and made me go ""thats",UNK
3655,"why I liked thid movie!"" But every know and them, some crappy effect will take you",UNK
3656,"right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in. And boom, your",UNK
3657,right back into realizing this film just doesn't live up to its premise. And heres another,UNK
3658,thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie. This movie is basically a,UNK
3659,"movie for kids. You know, giant robots duking it out? Stop motion animation? Hello? But this",UNK
3660,movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody. So,UNK
3661,I kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not? After a while I just,UNK
3662,"came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities, which really",UNK
3663,isn't a good mix. So for those of you who don't feel that certain naive childlike,UNK
3664,charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don't have a nostalgic connection,UNK
3665,to this movie (like I do) well Id suggest you steer clear away from this one.,UNK

3872,Harold Pinter rewrites Anthony Schaeffer's classic play about a man going to visit the husband of,UNK
3873,his lover and having it all go sideways. The original film starred Laurence Olivier and Michael,UNK
3874,Caine. Caine has the Olivier role in this version and he's paired with Jude Law. Here,UNK
3875,the film is directed by Kenneth Branaugh. The acting is spectacular. Both Caine and Law are,UNK
3876,gangbusters in their respective roles. I really like the chemistry and the clashing of personalities. It's,UNK
3877,wonderful and enough of a reason to watch when the script's direction goes haywire. Harold Pinter's,UNK
3878,dialog is crisp and sharp and often very witty and I understand why he was chosen,UNK
3879,to rewrite the play (which is updated to make use of surveillance cameras and the like).The,UNK
3880,problem is that how the script moves the characters around is awful. Michale Caine walks Law,UNK
3881,through his odd modern house with sliding doors and panels for no really good reason. Conversations,UNK
3882,"happen repeatedly in different locations. I know Pinter has done that in his plays, but in",UNK
3883,this case it becomes tedious. Why do we need to have the pair go over and,UNK
3884,over and over the fact that Law is sleeping with Caine's wife? It would be okay,UNK
3885,"if at some point Law said enough we've done this, but he doesn't he acts as",UNK
3886,if each time is the first time. The script also doesn't move Caine through his manipulation,UNK
3887,of Law all that well. To begin with he's blindly angry to start so he has,UNK
3888,no chance to turn around and scare us.(Never mind a late in the game revelation that,UNK
3889,makes you wonder why he bothered) In the original we never suspected what was up. here,UNK
3890,we do and while it gives an edge it also somehow feels false since its so,UNK
3891,clear we are forced to wonder why Law's Milo doesn't see he's being set up. There,UNK
3892,are a few other instances but to say more would give away too much. Thinking about,UNK
3893,the film in retrospect I think its a film of missed opportunities and missteps. The opportunities,UNK
3894,squandered are the chance to have better fireworks between Caine and Law. Missteps in that the,UNK
3895,choice of a garish setting and odd shifts in plot take away from the creation of,UNK
3896,a tension and a believable thriller. Instead we get some smart dialog and great performances in,UNK
3897,a film that doesn't let them be real. despite some great performances and witty dialog this,UNK
3898,is only a 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just doesn't work,UNK

3940,"sometimes, even ridiculous. The characters and the relationships among them are distorted. The story ends up",UNK
3941,"reaching nowhere, although it appears to go to some direction during the movie. It is understandable",UNK
3942,"that different times should be expected for the Corleone's saga in the 90's, and that we",UNK

3956,"seen them, I would have thought this good-looking but empty; since I had, I thought its",UNK
3957,"style inappropriate and its content insufficient. The idea of reviving the character in a bigger, slicker",UNK
3958,"production must have sounded good, but there was no point in it, other than the hope",UNK
3959,"of making money; it's just a show, which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the",UNK
3960,"character's world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he hasn't been already (also, the",UNK
3961,actor wasn't at his best). I'd been hoping to see Ichi at a late stage of,UNK
3962,"life, in a story that would see him out gracefully and draw some conclusion from his",UNK
3963,"experience overall; this just rehashes bits and pieces from the other movies, seasoned with more sex",UNK
3964,and sfx violence. Not the same experience at all.,UNK
3965,WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS A couple of years back I managed to see the first,UNK
3966,"five films in this franchise, and was planning to do an overview of the whole Elm",UNK
3967,"St. series. However, just two years on and I find I can't remember enough about them",UNK
3968,in order to do it  I guess they couldn't have made much of an impression.,UNK
3969,"From what I do recall, some of the sequels  Dream Warriors in particular  weren't",UNK
3970,"as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. Generally, the",UNK
3971,predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend,UNK
3972,"itself to narrative tension. But while I cannot recall much of the first five films, I",UNK
3973,do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddy's Dead. An indication of how sick of,UNK
3974,Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film,UNK
3975,was promoted solely on the character's demise. The fact that the movie's conclusion is not even,UNK
3976,"hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant,",UNK
3977,soulless and cynical this venture was. Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester,UNK
3978,"as the charismatic villain, Robert Englund's in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddy's mockery",UNK
3979,of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that,UNK
3980,"could ever watch this tripe. It's like Englund's crying out ""we know this is garbage ",UNK
3981,"but you're paying to see it, so who's the one laughing?"" And I'm sure victims of",UNK
3982,child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. Was Freddy's,UNK
3983,appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few,UNK
3984,"""haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars"" and that's it. If this was the only Elm",UNK
3985,St. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. Even as,UNK
3986,the character pre-death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a,UNK
3987,"slop of Transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony. Acting is almost universally",UNK
3988,poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body,UNK
3989,"language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice",UNK
3990,"Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The",UNK
3991,"script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road",UNK
3992,"map, upon which the Noel Coward-like Freddy has wittily written ""you're f**ked"". When prompted for the",UNK
3993,"map, Carlos responds ""well the map says we're f**ked"". Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde? Or",UNK
3994,"how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels?",UNK
3995,"So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound, given",UNK
3996,"that all sounds are magnified. Oddly, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his",UNK
3997,"voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. ""Nice hearing from you,",UNK
3998,"Carlos"", quips Freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. It's also worth noting that dream",UNK
3999,"sleep doesn't occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into Freddy's world. Though",UNK
